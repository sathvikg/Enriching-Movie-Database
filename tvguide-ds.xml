That's the revisionist spin on<i>Cinderella,</i>and it twirls very nicely. Poor orphaned Cinderella, a 16th-century French girl</paragraph><paragraph>who loses her beloved father and gains a just-short-of-wicked stepmother and two horrid stepsisters on the same awful day, is now called Danielle (Drew Barrymore). Her widowed father (Jeroen Krabbe), a free thinker who encouraged Danielle to read, speak her mind and treat all people as equals, has</paragraph><paragraph>a fatal heart attack shortly after marrying the elegant Baroness Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston), who longs for the glamour and intrigue of court society. Left to the social-climbing Rodmilla's less-than-tender mercies, Danielle is treated as a servant by step siblings Marguerite (Megan Dodds), a</paragraph><paragraph>stuck-up beauty, and plump, graceless Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey), and spends her days cleaning and tending livestock. But Danielle still catches the eye of rebellious Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), who's in the market for a bride: Unfortunately, she does so while in disguise<i>and</i>while</paragraph><paragraph>Baroness Rodmilla is doing her damnedest to promote Marguerite as the most marriageable girl in town. No, this isn't the classic Cinderella: It's an eclectic mix that ditches magic spells in favor of a message of self-reliance, and tosses in everything from the Mona Lisa (Leonardo da Vinci, who's</paragraph><paragraph>visiting the French court, acts as Danielle's benevolent protector) to a glass slipper from Ferragamo, then tops it off with Jeanne Moreau. As the<i>grande dame</i>who commands the movie's framing story, she advises the Brothers Grimm that she's very fond of their collection of folk stories, but</paragraph><paragraph>they got that Cinderella business all wrong. "How do you begin these tales?" she asks in her cigarettes-and-whiskey voice. "Ah, yes, once upon a time...

Teenage Samantha (Holmes) is desperate to begin her college career so she can escape the watchful eye of her parents (Michael Keaton, Margaret Colin) and dreams of driving alone cross-country to school in California from her Washington, D.C., home. Unfortunately, that's out of the question; not only are her parents overprotective, but they happen to be the President and First Lady of the United States, which means Samantha has a host of secret-service agents eyeballing her every move. While she loves many of the perks of being the Commander-in-Chief's kid &#x2014; big house, lots of traveling &#x2014; growing up in the spotlight has been difficult &#x2014; what teenager really wants her wardrobe choices to be the subject of public scrutiny? And blending in at school is hard enough for a freshman without her family being greeted by an entire marching band playing "Hail to the Chief." Samantha's spunky roommate, Mia (Amerie Rogers), does her best to get the first daughter to loosen up and enjoy her collegiate experience, including frat parties. But her guardian agents, Bock (Michael Milhoan) and Dylan (Dwayne Adway), are prone to panicking and cramping her style. Fortunately, Samantha's cute and funny resident advisor, James (Blucas), finds a way to sneak her out of the dorm for some typical dating fun. They begin to fall for each other, but when the press gets hold of the story the situation quickly spirals out of control; surprising secrets are revealed, and it doesn't help that it's an election year. Whitaker does his best to add tension and drama to this lightweight film, and while he manages to drum up some sympathy for poor little rich girl Samantha, even the slightest bit of<i>sturm und drang</i>seems out of sync with the fundamentally silly premise. The nearly laughable "once upon a time &#x2026;" narration that opens and closes the film only makes a muddled mess messier, but Keaton and Holmes have some sweet father-daughter moments and the supporting cast gives its all.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/daughter/review/137653#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Angel Cohn</i>

With Birdee<i>there,</i>no less, isolated in a soundproof booth and thinking she's going on-air to get a beauty makeover.

But expectations are different for a theatrical feature starring Al Pacino, and by those standards it's a preposterous misfire.</paragraph><paragraph>Nine years ago, Jack Gramm's (Pacino) testimony helped put Jon Forster (Neal McDonough) on death row for the torture killing of Joanie Cates (Vicky Huang). Dubbed the "Seattle Slayer," Forster always maintained his innocence, claiming both that Gramm lied under oath and that forensic psychiatry is voodoo science. On the eve of Forster's execution, the Seattle police discover a crime scene with all his trademarks: Is it the work of a copycat killer, or was Forster wrongly convicted? Worse still, the victim was one of Gramm's Northwest Washington University students; the FBI has picked up on rumors that he was sleeping with her, and the killer taped her pleading with him to admit that he falsified testimony. Shortly after, Gramm receives a phone call telling him he's going to die in 88 minutes. Over the course of the next hour and a half, Gramm is threatened, attacked and finds himself suspected of two gruesome murders. He becomes convinced that his tormentor must be someone close to him who's inexplicably conspiring to help Forster get a stay of execution and maybe even a new trial. Could it be Gramm's assistant, Shelly (Amy Brenneman)? Perhaps one of his students, like whip-smart Lauren (Leelee Sobieski) or sullen Mike (Benjamin McKenzie)? How about his teaching assistant, Kim (Alicia Witt), or maybe her ex-husband (Stephen Moyer), who did time at Walla Walla Prison -- where Forster is confined -- and has been lurking around a lot recently?

When this dark, casually cynical valentine to a pair of media-wise chippies who get away with murder opened in 1975, it was more admired than embraced, despite its Bob Fosse choreography, and music and lyrics by the celebrated team of John Kander and Fred Ebb; the friendlier<i>A Chorus Line</i>swept the Tonys and became Broaway's longest-running musical. Twenty-seven years later,<i>Chicago</i>'s sting is gone (the 1996 theatrical revival opened in the wake of O.J. Simpson's sensational murder trial) and its knowing depiction of sin, spin and fleeting celebrity seems matter-of-fact, almost quaint. But Broadway choreographer-director Rob Marshall's feature film debut is spectacular and sleekly entertaining, given considerable luster by an all-star cast who really can sing and dance. The plot is straightforward: one-time chorine Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), who dreams of stardom but settled for marriage to dependable Amos (John C. Reilly), shoots the bounder (Dominic West) who seduced her with the promise of showbiz introductions then callously dumped her before delivering. Taken to Cook County Jail, Roxie finds herself on murderess's row, where slinky hoofer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who murdered her husband and sister when she caught them in the wrong kind of act, is the undisputed star. Roxie's loyal husband hires flamboyant criminal attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who assures his guilty-as-sin clients that if Jesus had been tried in Chicago and ponied up $5000 for legal representation, things would have turned out better. Flynn gives Roxie a whole new image &#x2014; the wronged naif &#x2014; and soon Velma's vanished from the news. But the trial still looms, and there's always a glamorous new murderess waiting in the wings. Numbers have been trimmed and Fosse's choreography replaced by Marshall's (whose "Cell Block Tango" is a highlight), but the movie's spirit is close to the show's and unlike Baz Luhrmann (MOULIN ROUGE), Marshall generally opts for letting the musical numbers unfold in long shot to creating movement through editing (ironically, the method Fosse favored). Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon's solution to the fact that contemporary audiences are generally uncomfortable with classical movie conventions is both straightforward and savvy &#x2014; in fact, it's the same strategy used by modern-day Bollywood films. Non-musical scenes that move the narrative forward are staged realistically, while the lavish production numbers reflect the star-struck imagination of Roxie, for whom all the world ought to be a stage.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/chicago/review/135738#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Set in the post-WWII South and loosely based on the colorful career of real-life Louisiana governor Huey Long, the film charts the rapid rise and precipitous fall of the essentially good but corruptible Willie Stark (Sean Penn), who took on the moneyed Old Guard that kept "hicks" like Stark down in the mud while enriching themselves through cronyism, corruption and graft. A self-educated pig-farmer-turned-county-treasurer, Stark gets his big break when a fire escape collapses on a new local school, a school Stark had warned was being built with substandard materials by a firm closely connected to Louisiana politicos. The tragedy reminds people of the honest man who tried to blow the whistle on the scam, and when the political machine in Baton Rouge goes looking for a popular rube to split the "hick" vote and ensure the incumbent governor's reelection, gubernatorial aides Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) and Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson) call on Willie Stark. When Stark figures out he's being used, he delivers a fiery harangue against the powers-that-be, a rant whose righteous anger and populist rhetoric proves immediately popular with the "hicks" and turns Willie Stark into a political force. Forged in the crucible of political corruption, newly elected Governor Stark keeps his enemies close &#x97; he even hires Sadie and Tiny as aides. He also enlists the help of former<i>Chronicle</i>journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law), not because he wrote a series of favorable profiles about the Stark campaign, but because Jack represents the<i>other</i>Louisiana where Stark has yet to gain a foothold: the conservative, affluent world of Burden's Landing, where Jack grew up with his best friends Anne and Adam Stanton (Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffolo), children of the former governor, and their powerful uncle, Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), Jack's beloved godfather. Jack knows<i>he's</i>being used, but he believes in Stark's promise to provide poor Louisianans with roads, schools and hospitals, and when rumors of strong-arm tactics and graft reach his ears, Jack uses these noble ends to help justify Stark's questionable means. But when Stark orders Jack to dig deep into the seemingly incorruptible Judge Irwin's past for an exploitable bit of scandal that will force him to withdraw his support for Stark's impeachment, Jack finds himself torn between the blind innocence of his past and the reality of Louisiana's future. Fitting Warren's sprawling 700-page novel into a two-hour movie is a tall order &#x97; Rossen simply snipped out most of it &#x97; and the scars do show. We never see enough of the small compromises Willie Stark makes on the way up to fully grasp the tragedy of his fall. Some will undoubtedly find Penn's ham-boned, spittle-lashing performance a bit much, but it's a pretty close to Warren's original conception. Besides, few other actors could hope to compete with James Horner's overbearing, "Feel this now!" score.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/kings-men/review/282550#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

But the other half is breathtaking, simultaneously visually inventive and vividly attuned to the broad streak of melancholy that runs through some of the sunniest pop hits of the 1960s.</paragraph><paragraph>The year is 1968, and restless Jude (Jim Sturgess) sits on a deserted Liverpool beach, plaintively singing "Is there anybody going to listen to my story?" as he looks out to sea. Determined to escape the dead-end shipyard job where his dreams of being an artist die a little more every day, he leaves his conventional girlfriend (Lisa Hogg) and the single mother (Angela Mounsey) who raised him after her wartime romance with an American soldier went bad. Jude works his way to the U.S. as a deckhand and jumps ship, hoping to find the father he's heard works at Princeton University. The reunion isn't all he'd hoped, starting with the fact that his dad is a janitor, but Jude falls in with restless, free-spirited Max (Joe Anderson), who hates his wealthy family's lockjawed conformity and runs away to live<i>la vie de boheme</i>in Greenwich Village. Jude tags along, falls in love with Max's sister, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), who just lost her high-school sweetheart to the Vietnam War, and bears witness to the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll revolution. Their circle of friends and fellow travelers includes rockers Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), cheerleader-turned-lesbian-hippie Prudence (T.V. Carpio), student radical Paco (Logan Marshall-Green), merry prankster Dr. Robert (Bono), acid guru Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), and sundry dropouts, scenemakers and activists.  Any resemblance to Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin (whom Fuchs played in the Off-Broadway musical<i>Love, Janis</i>), Weather Underground founder Mark Rudd and other icons of the decade are strictly intentional.</paragraph><paragraph>The Beatles catalog spans the innocent optimism of early '60s beat boom hits like "All My Loving" and the pessimistic bad-trippiness of "Helter Skelter," so it's no stretch to find the entire history of the 1960s in their cumulative output. And Taymor's cast can sing, some astonishingly well. But for every brilliant reimagining of a familiar song &#x97; "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" as a plaintive expression of thwarted same-sex love &#x97; there's an obvious clunker like "Something in the Way She Moves," which Jude sings in the first flush of love for Lucy, or "Revolution," his reproach to Paco and his student activists. Daniel Ezralow's choreography, which relies heavily on ordinary movements in stylized patterns (like Twyla Tharp's numbers for 1979's HAIR), is equally uneven, but there are a couple of stunning sequences, notably the nightmarish induction fantasy set to "I Want You." And yes, that is Salma Hayek in the chorus line of sexily sinister nurses, perhaps repaying Taymor for lending her dramatic credibility with FRIDA (2002).<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/universe/review/290469#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Extreme-sports outlaw Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) lives to give the establishment the finger. We first see him stealing an uptight senator's sports car (the fascist fogie supports regulating violent video games) and driving it off a bridge, surfing the hood and parachuting to last-minute safety as the pricey wheels crash to the ground. Radical. Meanwhile, having just lost a suave, James Bond-style agent on a mission in Prague, veteran espionage agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is looking for an unconventional spy to take his place. Even among "the best and the brightest of the bottom of the barrel," Xander stands out. After putting Xander through some high-adrenaline tests, Gibbons makes his patriotic pitch. Xander refuses &#x2014; he isn't selling out to the man, not for fame, not for cash and certainly not for patriotic bombast. Undaunted, Gibbons switches to the DIRTY DOZEN/LA FEMME NIKITA approach: If Xander doesn't do his bit for flag and country, his tattooed ass is going to jail for a good long time. That works better, and Xander is dispatched to the Czech Republic to infiltrate "Anarchy 99," a gang of leather-clad thrill freaks led by disillusioned, former Soviet soldier Yorgi (Marton Csokas). Xander's cover &#x2014; he's looking to buy stolen high-performance sports cars &#x2014; is bolstered by his X-games credibility, and he's soon in like Flynn with Yorgi and Yorgi's lethal-looking lady (Asia Argento). Xander also learns that beneath their hard-partying, who-gives-a-damn facade, Yorgi and his gen-X comrades are masterminding a plan to plunge the world into chaos by unleashing a biological weapon code-named "Silent Night." The movie is designed to showcase Diesel's strengths (nice tats, surly delivery, wicked abs), pretty much to the exclusion of other considerations. Italian actress Argento (daughter of director Dario Argento) has a darkly sexy presence that occasionally shines through the testosterone-heavy bluster, but that's her own doing. The plot is minimal, the dialogue formulaic and the supporting cast loaded up with unknowns. The movie isn't hard to watch; it zips along at a good clip, never wasting time on exposition when there's something to break. But the irony is that, for all its "not your father's spy movie" posing, it's<i>exactly</i>like the later James Bond pictures: predictable, lightweight and 100-percent disposable.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/xxx/review/135806#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Back once again is Daniel Craig as the thuggish brute who pummels his way to solving the mystery continued from the previous installment. Stripped away of nearly every trait that the character has worn so well, this isn't the cinematic Bond of yore, rather a closer fit to the Ian Fleming mold of sophisticated brawler. Tonally,<i>Quantum of Solace</i>is a sobering hangover from the rousing experience of its predecessor. Where there was finely crafted action in the first, in its place are jarring action set pieces where disorienting camera moves and rapid editing rule the school. The days of the series' escapist entertainment are momentarily shelved, thanks to the unsteady hand of indie filmmaker Marc Forster, who seems far out of his league when painting on a canvas this large. What he brings to the table is a yearning to delve more into Bond's psyche -- it's just too bad that he felt the need to ape Mr. Bourne, Bond's cinematic cousin, when it came to crafting its action scenes, of which there are many. Dour, hyper-stylized, and completely gadget-less -- nobody does it better? Not in this case.</paragraph><paragraph>The film opens just where the last left off, with Bond bringing into custody a member of the secret society responsible for the death of his love, Vesper. But before any answers can be wrought, the criminal, Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), escapes, with the 007 agent hot on his heels. Working with M (played by the returning Judi Dench), Bond globetrots until he finds himself in South America, where he encounters Camille (Olga Kurylenko), another soul yearning for vengeance. Their mutual connection is Dominic Greene (<i>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</i>'s Mathieu Amalric), a businessman whose ties to the mysterious organization put him on the top of the suspect list. With the help of fellow agent Fields (Gemma Arterton) and returning CIA comrade Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), Bond and Camille make their last stand against the ones who have done them wrong, with the hope that this will close a chapter in both of their tortured existences.</paragraph><paragraph>Tortured is certainly one word for the film. While there are no rope-swinging knocks at Bond's manhood here, the entire film feels a bit too concerned with tying up the loose ends left over from<i>Casino</i>. This newfound focus on dramatics is commendable -- and no doubt the reason that Forster was brought onto the project, but at what cost was this realized? For starters, the film was put in the hands of someone utterly clueless as to how to handle the intense storytelling. With little regard for pacing, the artsy director plops in action scenes seemingly whenever he feels like it, likening the picture to a bad musical where songs just appear out of nowhere. Relying on the current cinematic landscape forged by Bourne is another monumental mistake for the series, and the sooner they rectify this, the better. Moreover, the film needs at least some iota of fun injected into it. Escapist entertainment this is not. A valid continuation of the franchise's sensibilities this is not. Audience members who are cool with that could find the proceedings to be a further breath of fresh air, though purists may likely walk away wondering whatever happened to the Bond that they know and love.</paragraph><paragraph>Performance-wise, Craig wins with his take on the role. His bullish Bond is a force of nature, narrowly determined to stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. Though still a continuation from what came before, there's something different in this performance that doesn't quite promise anything other than this character staying as severe as he is here, which is too bad. As far as the rest of the cast, Dench again scores as M. Given more screen time than ever before, she's the rock that has spanned two generations of the character and who will hopefully continue to add to the experience. Additionally, Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton both add their own flavor to the material, with Kurylenko pushing the Bond Girl mold into new dramatic territories. As the slimy bad guy, Mathieu Amalric excels, yet is missing a bit of over-the-top aplomb in his villainy. One interesting misstep is the wonderful Jeffrey Wright, who suddenly becomes a gruff Eastwood type under Forster's direction. Subtle he is not, but then again, neither is the film.</paragraph><paragraph>Clocking in at a brisk 105 minutes (the shortest in the series' history), this rare direct follow-up hopefully will put to rest the leftover emotional baggage of the character and leave Bond open to a bit more familiar interpretation in the future. While not the natural step after the end of<i>Royale</i>, it is its own animal -- and an unexpected one at that. The film will no doubt find its fans and lose just as many, but one thing is for sure -- this isn't the last we'll see of the daring agent. Let's hope next time the producers understand that Bond can stay mature without bowing down to current film trends and artistic ambition. People need to believe that there is still one number that they can always count on -- it's time to stay true to that promise.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/quantum-solace/review/292460#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Jeremy  Wheeler</i>

The heart of the problem is probably the fact that you're basing your screen story on something created in a medium where story isn't really necessary.<i>Max Payne</i>, however, finds a loophole in this conundrum, because it's a movie based on a game that was already sort of based on movies.</paragraph><paragraph>The video game of<i>Max Payne</i>is mostly just your basic third-person shooter -- the way it defines itself is through its modern-noir style. That's the key element that the movie ran with, and as a result, it isn't half bad. It's your basic hard-boiled detective story, where the titular hero strives tirelessly to solve the mystery of why his wife and child were murdered years before. The past is shown in golden-hued images of happy sunlight, while everything pictured in the present day is depicted in blue-filtered New York winter bleakness. Mark Wahlberg is more or less perfect for the role of a tough-guy rogue cop, and over the course of his super-gritty two-hour adventure, he gets to stoically stare down the barrel of a drug ring, the Russian Bond girl from<i>Casino Royale</i>, a big pharmaceutical conspiracy, and Mila Kunis pointing a gun at his head in a dark alley (imagine the voice of Meg Griffin telling you to put your hands above your head).</paragraph><paragraph>For a movie of its type,<i>Max Payne</i>is a little short on excitement and heavy on pathos, and there are lots of scenes where you can't believe people (namely Beau Bridges) are still talking. But when the action sequences happen, things get flat-out ridiculous, with fantastically crazy scenes where Wahlberg takes out fully armored, machine gun-toting SWAT team members with nothing but a handgun and a European-style leather jacket. In the end, you can't really discount the fact that as action movies, neo-noir films, and video-game adaptations go,<i>Max Payne</i>is pretty cool -- and definitely not like anything else. It's not exactly an amazing movie, but it unquestionably breaks the curse laid down by its predecessors (okay, mostly by Uwe Boll).<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/max-payne/review/295664#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila  Albertson</i>

The sexual revolution has passed Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) by: Married and pregnant at 17, she has spent</paragraph><paragraph>the Age of Aquarius raising 14-year-old Allison (Anna Paquin) and her younger brother Danny (Bobby Boriello); her stolid husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), a television repairman, has hocked his own dreams to the realities of providing for his wife and children. The counterculture is so alien to the</paragraph><paragraph>Kantrowitzs that the sight of hitchhiking hippies by the roadside is as exciting as spotting a bear in the backyard. All that changes during the summer of 1969, when Pearl, the children and Marty's mother (Tovah Feldshuh) make their annual pilgrimage to Dr. Folger's Catskill Bungalows. Their daily</paragraph><paragraph>routine of Mah Jongg, swimming and gossip is enlivened by the arrival of handsome Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), who has taken over the job of selling vacationing housewives blouses and accessories from a battered old bus. But noone is more captivated by Walker's flirty manner and low-key</paragraph><paragraph>sexiness than Pearl, who enters into an impetuous affair with him on the night of the first moon walk (hence the film's rather misleading title). Making his directing debut, actor Tony Goldwyn elicits top-notch performances from all concerned. They're helped by a strong script that makes both</paragraph><paragraph>Pearl's affair and its aftermath thoroughly convincing. This intimate, bittersweet romance is proof that a familiar story and the trappings of a done-to-death era can still seem fresh and engaging in the right hands.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/walk-moon/review/134065#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Set in Eastern Europe in 1904, the story concerns the fortunes of Yentl (Streisand), a girl who wants to study the Torah. Strict Jewish law</paragraph><paragraph>prohibits such knowledge for women, but Yentl won't give in to community pressure, so, after the death of her father, she disguises herself as a young man and leaves home, hoping to be accepted into a yeshiva. In this guise, she falls in love with fellow student Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), who takes</paragraph><paragraph>a liking to young Yentl, but never realizes that his friend is really a woman. When Avigdor's engagement to Hadass (Amy Irving) breaks off because her parents disapprove of him, Avigdor asks Yentl to marry Hadass in his stead. Can the deception continue?</paragraph><paragraph>Streisand has undertaken an extremely ambitious project to mark her directorial debut and, while far from perfect, the superstar performer shows undeniable promise. The production values are topflight but Streisand lacks visual skill and relies on the musical numbers to link episodes and detail</paragraph><paragraph>character motivation. In the opening sequences these songs, all sung by Streisand and structured as musical soliloquies, work quite well but they later become repetitious and intrusive--important characters are tossed aside to make room for her to belt out another tune. In all fairness, however,</paragraph><paragraph>Streisand is actually quite credible in her role and she elicits beautifully shaded performances from a large cast, particularly Patinkin and Irving. Streisand owned the movie rights to Singer's story for 14 years and finally acquired the clout to bring the project to life after many years of</paragraph><paragraph>trying. Singer, however, was appalled by the film.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/yentl/review/110034#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

By the time the long-awaited coda does come, the audience's patience (and trust) has been eroded, and the one scene that could have had the most emotional impact of all is rendered hopelessly ineffective.</paragraph><paragraph>It's easy to see why a filmmaker of Eastwood's caliber would be drawn to a story like the one that inspired<i>Changeling</i>, because the way in which the elements all come together seems almost too preposterous to be true. March 1928: Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home from work to discover that her nine-year-old son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), is nowhere to be found. After being forced to wait 24 hours to file a police report (a necessary "technicality" given the number of young children who simply run off with friends for a day), Christine embarks on a torturous quest over the coming weeks, dedicating her every waking moment to finding her missing son, supposedly with the help of the police. A few months later, LAPD captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) appears to deliver some astounding news -- Christine's son has been found, and he'll be arriving home shortly to be reunited with his mother. In most stories, this is where the nightmare ends; in Christine's, it's only the beginning. Immediately upon seeing her "son," she realizes that the police have made a terrible mistake. Not only is it a mistake that they're not willing to own up to, but one that the boy who claims to be her son is inexplicably playing along with wholeheartedly (even to the chilling point where he calls her "Mommy" behind closed doors). Though everyone in the city, including the outspoken Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), is well aware of the deep-rooted corruption within the LAPD, few would have suspected the reprehensible lengths to which they would go in order to cover up the truth and cling to power. When a young Canadian boy is discovered residing illegally on a nearby ranch, his capture sets into motion a remarkable series of events that will expose the deeply corrupt system for what it truly is, while finally setting the wheels of justice into motion.</paragraph><paragraph>Considering the story's many intriguing nuances, it's a small miracle that the screenplay doesn't get bogged down earlier than it actually does. Thanks to Eastwood's assured use of cinematic shorthand and some skillful editing by regular editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach, the first two hours of<i>Changeling</i>move along at a satisfying, deliberate pace that truly draws the viewer in. We feel the mother's anguish of knowing that her child could be out there waiting to be found, and share her helplessness when she falls victim to a venal legal system that's more interested in cornering the market on crime than helping the unfortunate victims.</paragraph><paragraph>As such a victim, Jolie quietly conveys the unfathomable pain of a mother who has lost her only son, often with little more than a wounded, glassy-eyed glance and a meek response to the intimidating powers that be. Watching her character evolve from a frightened and confused victim of the machine to a figure that inspires a fundamental change in the justice system is central to the success of the film, and helps to keep things interesting even after the action grinds to a halt in the interminable final act. Likewise, a pious Malkovich gives the crowd a character to cheer for just as the screenplay starts to meander, and -- in his role as suspicious ranch owner Gordon Northcott -- a giggling Jason Butler Harner accepts the full blunt of the audience's disdain with scenery-chewing abandon Yet, while Harner's nervous energy serves well to set some darker elements of the plot into motion at the midway mark, his unhinged performance doesn't benefit from extended screen time, and feels slightly out of place as the audience begins to understand the true nature of his character. Unfortunately, in the end, not even an Oscar-caliber crew on both sides of the camera can cover for the fact that the screenplay for<i>Changeling</i>simply flounders in the final act. Perhaps with a few more drafts, the filmmakers could have found a means of maintaining the quiet momentum displayed early on, but as it stands,<i>Changeling</i>is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that's dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/changeling/review/293871#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Jason Buchanan</i>

This 21st entry in the "official" Bond series (which includes neither 1983's creditable NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN nor the lame 1967 spoof CASINO ROYALE) is a reboot designed to strip away layers of mythology and mannerism left by five stars and dozens of writers and directors. The source is Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, 1953's<i>Casino Royale</i>, and new star Daniel Craig returns Bond to his roots. Rather than a sophisticated rake in a dinner jacket, he's a lone wolf barely reined in by his MI-6 handlers, a blunt and cruelly effective tool for termination with extreme prejudice. All of which is great and would be greater were the movie not two and a half hours long and front-loaded with fundamentally irrelevant action sequences. Apparently, no rethinking of the franchise extends to<i>not</i>cramming it full of show-offy stunts and flashy chase sequences, including the acrobatic pursuit of a suicide bomber through a Madagascar construction site that showcases the athletic martial-art<i>parkour</i>and a chase that ends on the tarmac at Miami International Airport. These delay the real start of the story, built around a high-stakes card game (<i>chemin de fer</i>in the novel, Texas Hold 'em in the movie). Slippery underworld banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), preferred financier of international terrorists, has lost disastrously playing the stock market and intends to recoup his losses at the poker table, arranging a game with a $10 million buy-in at Montenegro's Casino Royale. Bond's mission &#x2014; his first after achieving coveted "00" status &#x2014; is to bankrupt Le Chiffre. Craig's Bond-in-progress is a brutally vivid creation, from the opening black-and-white sequence in which he earns his license to kill to his position on the iconic question "shaken or stirred?" &#x2014; "Do I look like I give a damn?" &#x2014; to the moment he slips on his first tuxedo and sees the potential in putting a sophisticated face on his animal instincts. The women &#x2014; not "Bond Girls" in any pop-culture sense of the term &#x2014; are forgettable. Only Vesper Lynd matters at all, and Eva Green's smudgy presence makes it hard to buy her as the woman with whom this hard-bitten Bond falls deeply and ruinously in love. Only the new theme song is less memorable. But the strong supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffery Wright and Judi Dench, the sole holdover from the Brosnan era. As M, Dench knows she has a tiger by the tail and isn't fazed in the slightest. Reservations aside, the film marks the beginning of a new phase in James Bond's history, and it promises to be a gripping one.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/casino-royale/review/284443#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Dorky Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) is entering his freshman year at Sky High, the top-secret vocational academy for the power-blessed that produced his parents, granite-jawed, second-generation superhero Commander Stronghold (Kurt Russell) and high-flying Josie Jetstream (Kelly Preston). They're tickled beyond belief that Will is going to their alma mater. What they don't know &#x97; because Will has been too embarrassed to tell them &#x97; is that he doesn't have any superpowers, a deficiency that becomes all too apparent during the school's humiliating Power Placement tests. These funnel incoming students into two tracks: either "Hero," or the dreaded "Hero Support," which grooms unfortunates with not-so-super talents &#x97; say, a knack for glowing feebly in the dark or shape shifting, but only into a guinea pig &#x97; for the second-class life of a sidekick. Will lands in the Support group with his best friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker) &#x97; who has powers but opted out of the "fascistic" selection process &#x97; and finds a mortal enemy in Warren Peace (Steven Strait), who can shoot fireballs from his fingertips and hates all Strongholds because the Commander busted his dad. After doing time in high-school purgatory, tormented by bullies, ignored by the cool kids and embarrassed by his own feebleness, Will gets his powers, acts like a jock &#x97; sorry,<i>jerk</i>&#x97; and learns his lesson in time to do right by everyone. Movies like THE INCREDIBLES (2004), whose story, characters and themes play in different but equally resonant ways for small children, teenagers and adults, are harder to make than is generally supposed, and comic-book movies that appeal to nonfans are harder still. SKY HIGH's juvenile tone and formulaic story are geared to preteens, and the sop of baby boomer-friendly casting like<i>Wonder Woman</i>Lynda Carter as Principal Powers or former Disney child star Russell as a supersquare dad isn't enough to keep adults from squirming with boredom. But how many 10-year-olds are crazy for the squeaky-clean charms of old-fashioned superheroes, insipid covers of '80s hits or indulgent high-school nostalgia? As to the idea that it's a John Hughes film "with capes" (as producer Andrew Gunn declared), John Hughes' teen comedies were neither stupid nor condescending. This film is both.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/sky-high/review/191281#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

After a disastrous plane ride -- courtesy of some militarily inclined penguins -- they instead end up at an African wildlife reserve, where Alex has an unexpected reunion with the parents he was separated from as a cub. This storyline, in which Alex attempts to win the acceptance of his alpha-lion Dad, is so tired that not even a go-for-broke Alec Baldwin, as the scheming bad guy, can salvage it.</paragraph><paragraph>Baldwin isn't the only one giving it his all, because Sacha Baron Cohen, who provided the funniest moments in the first film as King Julien the Lemur, returns with a mad gusto that makes the film worthwhile whenever his character is onscreen. Like Robin Williams in<i>Aladdin</i>, Cohen flowers here because of the visual freedoms that animation allows. The filmmakers make sure Julien's physical look matches the voice no matter how demented it gets, and they succeed so grandly that you feel an anticipatory buzz during all his scenes, because truly anything could happen. If both<i>Madagascar</i>movies were just about Julien and the penguin commando squad, they would be comic gems.</paragraph><paragraph>Unfortunately, for all the stuff that works well in<i>Madagascar 2</i>, the movie suffers from a serious case of unoriginality, largely because DreamWorks slavishly adheres to the recipe they believe made<i>Shrek</i>a box-office giant: genuine wit + fart jokes + gooey sentiment + overly familiar pop tunes = cross-generational appeal. This time around, the incessant onslaught of music and gags never gels with the overly familiar storylines -- resulting in a film that barely satisfies an entire family. The<i>Madagascar</i>movies are like family meal deals from a chain restaurant that only serves pizzas loaded with everything -- it might seem like a good idea, but nobody gets what they really want.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/madagascar-escape-2-africa/review/295820#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Perry  Seibert</i>

Larson</name><role>Assoc. Producer</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>3</review-rating><review><paragraph>For all the epic visuals and phenomenal production design, Edward Zwick's 19th-century drama of a disillusioned American war hero who finds redemption in the way of the samurai is an honorable film hamstrung by Hollywood conventions. 1876: Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a drunken ruin of the war hero he once was, haunted by his part in the slaughter of innocent Native Americans and reduced to shilling for the Winchester rifle company. An old army buddy, Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly), approaches him about a better gig. The Japanese government is hiring American military experts to train the imperial army in the ways of modern warfare, and paying handsomely. Despite the fact that taking the job means working with craven Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), whom he despises, Algren accepts. Once in Japan, Algren realizes the dimensions of the game in which he's become a pawn. Nominally governed by a teenaged emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura), Japan is divided between imperial advisors who favor all things new and Western &#x97; often to their own benefit &#x97; and those who, like samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), counsel respect for feudal traditions. Algren is forced to face Katsumoto's warriors before his troops are ready and is taken prisoner; Katsumoto spares Algren's life so he can learn about his opponents, but it's Algren who gets the real education. Forced to spend the winter in Katsumoto's remote mountain village, Algren gradually learns to respect the samurai code, with its emphasis on loyalty, honor, respect for enemies, acceptance of destiny and vivid appreciation of everyday life. He stops drinking, learns Japanese and trains in the samurai arts, earning Katsumoto's friendship and his warriors' grudging respect. But as the spring draws near, Algren is forced to make hard choices about his place in the world. If ever a film cried out for Akira Kurosawa's pragmatic bleakness, it's this high-minded yet simplistic story of courage and spiritual redemption. Unwilling to offend, Zwick whitewashes a culture in which brutality and contemplative beauty were inextricably intertwined and, afraid to alienate audiences, he shies away from the story's logical downbeat conclusion, replacing it with an "ambiguous" ending that recalls, of all things, THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981). Cruise gives a thoroughly respectable performance, but he can't make a symbol of the failures of Western capitalist thinking into a truly convincing character. The charismatic Watanabe fares better, but the film never broaches the limitations of samurai thinking, with its inflexible emphasis on obedience and fealty to class-bound codes of behavior.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/samurai/review/132449#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Ferris maintains regular phone contact with his boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), a CIA bigwig -- forever on his cell phone -- dispensing directives while attending to domestic duties like kiddie soccer games. After a promotion, Ferris becomes the Agency's number one man in Jordan, quickly earning the trust of Jordanian intelligence official Hani (Mark Strong in a scene-stealing performance) -- a relationship that Hoffman compromises in an attempt to catch one of the world's most feared terrorists.</paragraph><paragraph>All of these characters come to life thanks to William Monahan's airtight adaptation of David Ignatius' novel, and each of the talented actors. In addition to serving up some deliciously funny one-liners, Monahan employs a simple step-by-step construction in order to tell this remarkably complicated espionage tale -- a story chock-full of divided loyalties and paranoia. The audience always knows exactly as much as Ferris does, a fact that keeps his motivations -- and therefore the entire plot -- clear. DiCaprio is, in no uncertain terms, a movie star; and this is a star turn. He's certainly credible as an action hero, but he also communicates intelligence, fear, and an inherent morality in the scenes between the big explosions. This accomplishment makes the chases and gunfights all the more entertaining because we actually care about the person whose life is constantly at risk. Crowe complements DiCaprio as the Aussie's strong physical presence plays off DiCaprio's inherent softness (no matter how much time he spends in the weight room, Leo will always be a babyface).</paragraph><paragraph>Ridley Scott's movies have always betrayed his formative years in advertising; his films offer loads of surface pleasure, but they rarely have strong ideas. The crisply photographed and edited<i>Body of Lies</i>reveals some ambition, for while it certainly works as pure entertainment, this tale of a good man trying to extract himself from an impossible situation offers some commentary on America's feelings about being in Iraq. Fortunately, Scott never hammers this point home, and the result isn't a lecture about American foreign policy, but a smartly updated old-fashioned espionage thriller.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/body-lies/review/293209#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Perry Seibert</i>

When she awakes twenty years later, unlike Sleeping Beauty, it's to recriminations and a painful readjustment to married life and motherhood. Helplessly observing her now-grown daughter Emma (Heather Stephens) headed into a bad marriage, Lizzie also resents how close Emma's become to Lizzie's old best friend Gail (Bess Armstrong). As if she didn't already feel extraneous, Lizzie learns that her once loving spouse Alex (Tim Matheson) and Gail have had a long-standing affair. Angry at being babied and devastated by her spouse's infidelity, Lizzie runs away to revisit her childhood haunts, unsure whether she can forgive Alex and Gail, or whether there's a place for her in her daughter's life. Forever scrambling back and forth in time, this freesia-scented romance is the artistic equivalent of a soothing aromatherapy candle. In typical network TV fashion, the script, loosely based on a true story, soft pedals dramatic conflicts that should've been handled with candor, then offers soapy solutions. What's more, it would've taken a flamboyant filmmaker like Pedro Almodovar to do justice to the bizarre subject matter, as he did with LIVE FLESH. As if hemmed in by the script's and director's restraint, the actors acquit themselves with understatement. Everyone except C&amp;W superstar Reba McEntire, that is, who acts up a spring rain &#x97; if not an entire storm! Packaged on video with a music video at the end, this TV movie is actually a sales pitch for McEntire's versatility. She does everything well, but not especially memorably.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/forever-love/review/135607#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Robert Pardi</i>

Freudeman</name><role>Set Decorator</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>4</review-rating><review><paragraph>A hilarious spoof of American politics, this film marked the directorial debut of the mercurial and brilliant Preston Sturges, one of the best writer-directors of the 1940s. While this film never reaches the giddy heights of some of his subsequent films, THE GREAT MCGINTY was a favorable</paragraph><paragraph>harbinger of the therapeutic madness to come.</paragraph><paragraph>The film opens in a smoky banana-republic bar largely patronized, it seems, by Americans on the lam. One such denizen, Thompson (Heydt), is a one-time chief cashier of a major bank turned embezzler. Now dejected from hiding out in this steamy exile, he attempts suicide in the men's room but he's</paragraph><paragraph>stopped by the bartender, Dan McGinty (Donlevy). McGinty has an even more ignominious tale to tell: he used to be governor of a state! His strange story unravels in flashback.</paragraph><paragraph>McGinty begins as a seedy hobo looking for a quick buck. During an election in a major city, he's hired by a slick politician (Demarest) to vote repeatedly using the names of dead citizens. He proves to be an overzealous participant in the democratic process, voting dozens of times at an expected</paragraph><paragraph>$2 per vote but the politico is unable to come across with the dough. McGinty remains persistent. He's taken to the party hall where The Boss (Tamiroff) is so taken with the bum's moxie that he appoints him a collector of funds in his protection racket. McGinty proves himself a born collector and</paragraph><paragraph>he continues moving up the ladder of crime until he is finally ready for the big time--politics.</paragraph><paragraph>Donlevy, in an early starring role, gives a marvelous performance as a dim-witted bum who's transformed into a polished politician. The flamboyant Tamiroff's rendering of the boss is a comic delight. Demarest is colorful and full of street savvy and wit, once remarking: "If you didn't have graft,</paragraph><paragraph>you'd have a lower class of people in politics!" This terrific satire was the brainchild of screenwriter Sturges, who, by the time he penned this script, was the highest-paid writer in Hollywood, having written films such as EASY LIVING and DIAMOND JIM.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/great-mcginty/review/125105#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

Jackson looming over a half-naked &#x2014; and chained &#x2014; Christina Ricci, everything about Craig Brewer's follow-up to HUSTLE &amp; FLOW is designed to make you think you're in for the sleaziest, Southern-fried potboiler since SHANTY TRAMP. But while the film kicks off with a steamy shot of Ricci strutting down a country road in cowboy boots and hot pants short enough to shame Daisy Duke herself, Brewer&#x2019;s torrid tale turns out to be a surprisingly sweet &#x2014; if not entirely innocent &#x2014; fable about emotional redemption and self-worth.</paragraph><paragraph>Just hours after her sweetheart Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves town to fulfill his commitment to the National Guard, Rae (Ricci), a "bad" girl with a terrible cough and a worse reputation, is out on the dusty backroads of her small Tennessee town looking for a little fun. After a sweaty night of pills, booze and random sex, Rae is beaten up and clad in nothing but a barely there crop-top and a pair of white panties, and then dumped in a ditch not far from the small farm owned by Lazarus Woods (Jackson). Lazarus is an aging musician who's just gotten another lesson in the meaning of the blues: His bored younger wife (Adriane Lenox) has just left him for his own younger brother (Leonard L. Thomas). Finding Rae sprawled unconscious on the side of the road, Lazarus scoops her up and takes her inside, but having already been "toe to toe with the law&#x2026; for no more than being black and nearby," he decides against calling the police, even though Rae clearly needs a doctor for both her bruises and her high fever. Instead, Lazarus cleans her up as best he can and gets some help from Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson), a pharmacist who slips him a bottle of prescription medicine free of charge. Still delirious with fever, Rae mumbles the name "Tehronne" (David Banner), a dealer and a small-time pimp who assures Lazarus that he never laid a hurtful finger on Rae. Tehronne does, however, warn Lazarus that if he&#x2019;s thinking of shacking up with Rae, he should know that she's subject to spells of nymphomania that send her out into the night like a cat in heat. Lazarus is thinking nothing of the sort, but to keep her from wandering off in a fever delirium, he ties her to his radiator with a heavy gauge chain.

A remake of the 1951 classic, this film tries to increase the freaky factor with modern-day special effects and update the original movie's message about nuclear war with a vague moral about humankind's general mismanagement of the planet. This actually sounds like a fairly solid premise, but it doesn't always work -- even if you don't think about the massive shoes it's trying to fill.</paragraph><paragraph>The story begins with Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), a young widow who was left to care for her eight-year-old stepson, Jacob, when her husband died the previous year. She spends her days in a university lab working as a research scientist in astrobiology, so naturally when a big alien orb shows up in Manhattan, she's called in by the U.S. government to offer expertise on its inhabitant -- an alien representative named Klaatu who, in order to survive Earth's atmosphere, must manifest himself in the form of Keanu Reeves. Of course, the government, led by Secretary of State Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), reacts hostilely to Klaatu's arrival, thus failing the test he was sent here to administer: to decide whether humans can continue to be trusted with planet Earth.</paragraph><paragraph>With Dr. Benson's help, Klaatu is able to get the upper hand with his Secret Service captors and use his alien powers of electricity to escape. He takes off with Benson and young Jacob, who's very surly and unresolved over his dad's death. They learn what Klaatu was sent to Earth for, but of course, they also demonstrate the love-in-the-face-of-turmoil that might convince him to spare humanity -- despite its epic squandering of a planet that can support complex life (a rarity in the universe at large). All three of the main actors turn in solid performances, even Jaden Smith (the spawn of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith), who plays Jacob. And in a very cool and unexpected choice by the filmmakers, the role is devoid of any and all quippy racial stereotyping; the fact that Helen's stepson is black is never even mentioned in the script. It also has to be said that Keanu Reeves was kind of born for this role. It sounds a little pejorative to say that his biggest talent is playing someone kind of non-human, and a little dead-behind-the-eyes, but not everybody can do it, and he does it better than everybody.</paragraph><paragraph>Unfortunately, that whole first act -- when there are mysterious vessels landing and giant expressionless robots emerging and people completely freaking out -- should feel pretty scary and ominous, but it really doesn't. It's not boring either, but if<i>Cloverfield</i>can conjure up an eerie sense of foreboding, apocalyptic danger, you'd think that this movie could, too. Instead, it just feels vaguely weird. Things pick up quite a bit when the action starts, and events build toward the awesomely strange method by which the aliens were planning on wiping humanity and its structures off the Earth. But even then, it can sometimes feel a little chintzy, and the idea that we're supposed to be imbibing an important message from the story feels watered down -- because if the filmmakers were hoping to draw a parallel between 1951's threat of nuclear war and 2008's threat of global warming, they don't take a very direct route in doing so. Like everything else in the movie, this idea still comes across, just not as sharply as we'd like it to.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/day-earth-stood/review/292495#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila  Albertson</i>

Pierce Brosnan's sophomore effort duplicates the virtues of GOLDENEYE: Hong Kong action legend Michelle Yoeh is a phenomenal addition to the pantheon of Bond girls (Teri Hatcher isn't, but she's dealt with expediently), Jonathan Pryce's villain -- press mogul Elliott Carver -- is shrewdly overwrought and, in a clean break from a disagreeable tradition, the movie actually ends when it's over, rather than dragging viewers through a series of bogus -- sorry,<i>bonus</i>-- climaxes that leave them feeling as though they've been hauled through an explosive wringer. Brosnan's Bond delivers a few of the juvenile one-liners for which the series is famous, but the real humor comes from seeing Bond treated with such withering disdain by his cohorts: Q (Desmond Llewelyn), M (Judi Dench) and Miss Monneypenny (Samantha Bond) treat him as though he were a bright but undisciplined adolescent who needs a firm talking-to. Even Bond's new car talks back to him. The plot involves Carver's attempts to engineer a world crisis that will benefit his global media empire, including a fledgling satellite news network. To that end he and his nefarious cohorts, led by psycho Aryan ubermensch Stamper (Gotz Otto) sink a British naval ship and blame it on the Chinese. Pryce has a fine old  time playing media megalomaniac Carver as an ungodly hybrid of Rupert Murdoch and William Randolph Hearst by way of Charles Foster Kane: The highlight of his upstart news network's launch is the reading of Carver's declaration of principles. Ultimately, though, the film is forgettable even by the standards of prefabricated pop ephemera.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/tomorrow-dies/review/132591#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

In a word, no. GOLDENEYE, starring Pierce Brosnan as Bond No. 5, should appeal equally to die-hard Bond</paragraph><paragraph>fans and bonded DIE HARD fans.</paragraph><paragraph>Lean, dark and graceful, Brosnan wraps his perfectly calculated accent around all the standard phrases without making us hear quotation marks. He's a worthy Bond, glib and convincingly athletic, and ought to last a good half-dozen films before his waist thickens and his solid good looks begin to</paragraph><paragraph>slide. And although GOLDENEYE is the first Bond film that owes nothing to Ian Fleming but 007 himself, that's no particular drawback. The Bond movies, particularly the later ones, were less about plot than trappings: cool gear, perverted bad guys, gorgeous girls and exotic locations. The writers</paragraph><paragraph>get the mix just about right, and first-time Bond director Martin Campbell moves things along fairly briskly.</paragraph><paragraph>The plot is along the usual lines, involving a Russian satellite, code-named GoldenEye, that comes under the control of supervillains Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) and General Ourumov (Gottfried John). GoldenEye has the power to destroy anything containing an electrical circuit, up to and including</paragraph><paragraph>an entire city, and the villains plan to decimate London while also making themselves super-rich. If there's a twist, it's that Alec is not the usual foreign criminal mastermind, but a former friend and colleague of Bond's. Bond, in fact, has been racked with guilt (!) for years, convinced he</paragraph><paragraph>caused Alec's death during an operation in the former Soviet Union.</paragraph><paragraph>More importantly, let's talk about girls, beginning with the new M -- surely the first of Bond's bosses to call him a misogynist dinosaur. Dame Judi Dench plays M as a steely schoolmarm who coolly tells her underlings that if she wants sarcasm, she'll talk to her children, utterly unconcerned that</paragraph><paragraph>admitting she's borne babies will undermine her authority. No one could mistake her for a den mother, unless the den were in Sparta.</paragraph><paragraph>Representing the baddies is Famke Janssen as the ultravixenish Xenia Onatopp. Janssen is all wide, devouring mouth and rolling eyes: She looks like a European adult-comic-book diva, always on the verge of dissolving into bold black lines and twinkling white highlights. That she kills men by</paragraph><paragraph>scissoring them between her thighs strikes at least some of them as a reasonable exchange. Last and, yes, least memorable is the Bond girl proper, Russian computer whiz Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), just as lovely and pliant as Bond needs her to be.</paragraph><paragraph>GOLDENEYE's opening credits sequence is simply stunning, a surreal pop fantasy of Soviet Realist statues and Janus-headed babes whose mouths are equally likely to hold cigars as smoking guns. Who could not love the sight of near-naked girls writhing atop Lenin's bronze head as great</paragraph><paragraph>hammer-and-sickle sculptures drop through the air and shatter on impact?</paragraph><paragraph>The James Bond series looked in trouble when Timothy Dalton -- the second-most unfortunate successor to definitive Bond Sean Connery -- failed to single-handedly galvanize THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL. No matter that Roger Moore's lightweight characterization and a series of</paragraph><paragraph>increasingly silly stunts had already begun to sabotage the franchise; Dalton took the rap, and the search for a new Bond was on. For the moment, at least, the producers have found the right man for the job.</paragraph><paragraph>GOLDENEYE goes on a bit, but it was the Bond series that taught today's action directors to go for that extra few minutes of exotic locale, ante-upping gadgetry or spectacularly choreographed<i>mano a mano</i>action. By the time Bond and Natalya are buzzing around Cuba in a private plane, some viewers</paragraph><paragraph>will be plotting their way out of the theater. Others, notably the toy-loving boys for whom 007 has always exerted the greatest pull, will doubtless wish it could all go on forever.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/goldeneye/review/130384#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

It's the reason we go to the movies in the first place, and by the time it reaches its climax, you're likely to be yelling at the screen the same way that television viewers around the world did back when<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>was at the peak of its popularity. Whether you go to the movies to be thrilled, terrified, elated, inspired, or simply entertained,<i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>does not disappoint. At this point in his career, Boyle has worked in a variety of genres, and here they all come together to create the perfect cinematic storm, an irresistible burst of big-screen optimism that will have the critics swooning and the cynics smiling. Of course, there are times when the waters can get pretty rough for India's most beloved dark-horse game-show contestant, but what are the best moments in life without the worst ones to make them all the more meaningful?</paragraph><paragraph>The first time we see Jamal, he's being tortured by the police. He's just come off the set of<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>, and the authorities are convinced that he's just cheated his way to the million-dollar question. But Jamal is no cheat, and as he recalls the life experiences that taught him the answers to the questions he was asked on the popular game show, we come to learn why street smarts are as essential to surviving in the slums of Mumbai as ruthless business savvy is to rising through the criminal ranks. Jamal and his older brother, Salim, were just young boys when their single mother was killed by rioters right before their eyes, and after being orphaned they lived in a garbage dump just to survive. In those dark days, the only thing that kept Jamal going was his love for the beautiful Latika. She, too, was an orphan, and upon joining the two brothers, she was forever bound by fate to both of them. Later, when Jamal and Salim were driven apart by lust and greed, Jamal and Latika were forced to go their separate ways. Now, years later, Jamal is determined to get his lady back, and reasoning that the best way to find her is to become a contestant on the nation's most popular game show, the lovelorn "chai boy" lands an appearance on<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>. But Jamal never thought that he would even get close to winning the top prize, and when he does, the authorities want to know how a kid born in the ghetto could possibly know the answers to such difficult questions.</paragraph><paragraph>Thus begins a truly remarkable tale of hope, love, and profound adversity. As the detective reviews a videotape of Jamal's appearance on<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>, the irrepressible "slumdog" tells the story of how he came to know the answer to each question in vivid detail. Each answer is a journey unto itself -- sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes humorous -- and the further we travel, the more we become invested in the characters. Through it all, we come to understand just what a decent person Jamal truly is, and why his romance with Latika seemed doomed from the moment they first met. This effect is owed largely to actor Dev Patel, who portrays the older Jamal with such terminal honesty that he gives us a constant place to project our optimism. We relate to him, and after experiencing his hardships, we want desperately to see him win the money and walk away with the girl. His innocence is infectious, and even as different actors take over the role throughout Jamal's journey to adulthood, that purity remains a compelling constant. It's a testament to the casting that we always know Jamal, Salim, and Latika the moment they appear onscreen, and in a movie as nonlinear as<i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>, it's essential that the viewer doesn't get distracted from the story by the struggle to pick out the main players. Fortunately, that never happens, leaving us free to lose ourselves in Simon Beaufoy's smartly structured screenplay, Anthony Dod Mantle's hyper-saturated, glowingly gritty photography, and Chris Dickens' crackerjack editing -- all of which are marvelously held together by veteran Bollywood composer A.R. Rahman's buoyant score, an invogorating fusion of Eastern and Western musical sensibilities. A great movie is something more than the sum total of all its parts, and here, the elements all come together to form a feature that speaks a universal form of optimism that isn't likely to get lost in translation, no matter where it screens, or who is watching.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/slumdog-millionaire/review/295865#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Jason  Buchanan</i>

Cage creates a homey and thoroughly likable character who earns the respect of the audience, but Hunter is the real surprise.

The fate of the Earth hangs on a quartet of ancient stones, which must be aligned in an ancient Egyptian temple... oh, forget that part.

It's all densely imagined and</paragraph><paragraph>more than a little goofy -- perhaps too goofy for the average American viewer, who may also find that the flamboyant tomfoolery of hypersexed (if ambiguously) interstellar DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) verges on the stereotypically offensive.

It's musical writing in reverse -- something Broadway audiences craving familiar, unchallenging material have come to demand -- and whatever charms it may have had as a live production have been lost in director Phyllida Lloyd's sloppy big-screen translation.</paragraph><paragraph>Born and raised on the idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi where her American mom, Donna (Meryl Streep), has been running her own ramshackle but charming inn for the past 15 years, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to marry her fiance, Sky (HISTORY BOY'S Dominic Cooper). The ceremony will take place at tiny chapel perched high above the Aegean and the reception will be held at "Villa Donna" which, on the eve of the nuptials, has begun to fill with guests. Sophie's best friends (Ashley Lilley, Rachel McDowall) have arrived as have Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters), Donna's two mates from the good old days when they performed in platform boots and sequined bell sleeves as the glitzy '70s glam trio "Donna and the Dynamos." But there's one important person who isn't on the guest list, because Sophie has no idea who he is: her father. Sophie was the unexpected end result of one footloose summer her mother spent on Kalokairi 20 years earlier, and Donna herself doesn't really know whose seed stuck. Desperately wanting her father to walk her down the aisle and give her away at the altar, Sophie pores over her mother's old diary for clues and comes up with three likely suspects: stuffy banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), adventurous travel writer Bill Austin (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Donna's one true love who broke her heart when he returned to his fiancee. Certain she'd know which one is her dad the moment she lays eyes on him, Sophie, unbeknownst to Donna, invites them all to Kalokairi, then swears them all to secrecy. But deceiving Donna leads to a number of comic misunderstandings and comedic errors and a total of 22 -- count 'em, 22 -- random ABBA songs that come so fast and thick and loud it leaves characters shouting over the soundtrack to be heard.</paragraph><paragraph>Constructing a musical around a preexisting set of songs isn't always a bad thing: Look at MOULIN ROUGE! the recent French hit CHANSONS D'AMOUR, or Julie Taymor's visionary ACROSS THE UNIVERSE which put a fresh spin on age-old Beatles classics by setting them in imaginative but always appropriate contexts. Had the action here been set in, say, in the 1970s, and reflected the real content of ABBA's songs -- the best of which are melancholy pop confections that often reflected the very real emotional turmoil that was tearing the group apart -- Lloyd, the director of the original stage production, might have produced something more than an ingratiating karaoke sing-along set in a pretty locale. Streep works very, very hard and manages to pull it off (even if it means acting slightly drunk) and Baranski is so good with such bad material you want to sneak her off this picture and into something better worth her time and talent. But the direction is slack -- it's Lloyd's first feature film and it shows -- the choreography clumsy and every ten minutes there's yet another gratuitous showstopper shouting in your face and insisting you have a good time.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/mamma-mia/review/292487#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

At the fork in a dusty desert road, two pop-culture images of the 1950s diverge. A car filled with fresh-faced teens zooms off in one direction, all giggles and post-war consumer optimism. A military convoy turns off and proceeds to the mysterious Groom Lake military facility base &#x2013; the fabled Area 51 &#x2013; and murders everyone who stands between them and a warehouse stacked high with crates crammed with things the government wants to keep hidden. The convoy is made up of Soviet spies in disguise, led by Louise Brooks-bobbed she-wolf Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who's shanghaied Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his old OSS buddy, Mac (Ray Winstone), to help her find one<i>particular</i>crate, containing a top-secret whatzit she believes will help Russia win the arms race. Jones isn't about to let her have it, and she's not about to let him stop her.</paragraph><paragraph>And that, in a nutshell, is the plot. Everything else is highly decorative window dressing. Some is specific to the era: The atomic test village peopled by doomed mannequins, the red-baiting FBI agents, the evil Russians (Blanchett's Natasha Fatale accent and all), the malt-shop brawl where greasers and clean-cut college kids duke it out to a rock 'n' roll beat, the mind control experiments, the wicked Russians, the WILD ONE staging of brainy biker Mutt Williams' (Shia LaBeouf) entrance. Some is the stuff of historical esoterica: The fabled lost city of El Dorado, the rock crystal skulls that seem beyond the abilities of the primitive Mesoamerican cultures to which they're attributed, the Nazca lines &#x2013; giant, ancient glyphs visible only from the air. And the rest is Indy-world lore: The affectionate references to the late Dr. Henry Jones Sr. and Marcus Brody, a quick shot of the Ark of the Covenant peeping out of a broken crate, the reappearance of Indy's one true love, the feisty Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the inevitable snake, plus miscellaneous icky bugs, scary locals, ever-escalating feats of derring do and self-aware tough-guy quips.</paragraph><paragraph>The overall effect is either exhilarating or exhausting, depending on your emotional investment in the franchise, but credit where credit is due: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set out to make one for the fans and delivered. For all the sound and fury, the result lacks the archly retro-freshness of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981), but how could it? You can't dash through the same river twice.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/indiana-jones-kingdom-crystal-skull/review/290748#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Director Garth Jennings and screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick, who revised the script Adams completed before his death in 2001, remain true to the material's shaggy, baggy spirit and successfully resist the temptation (or more likely pressure) to turn the movie into a gigantic CGI spectacle. Shortly before Earth is vaporized to make way for a hyperspace bypass, shabby little everyman Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is busy processing a series of life-altering revelations. First there's the news about Earth, then the fact that his friend, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien researching new material for the intergalactic best-seller "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," the bible of cosmic thumb-tripping. Veteran hitcher Ford gets them an illicit lift on one of the very ships that just destroyed Earth, and masterminds &#x2014; if you can call it that &#x2014; their escape from the awful Vogons, bureaucratic overlords of the universe. Ford and Arthur's next ride is aboard the<i>Heart of Gold</i>, which Ford's cousin, renegade Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell), an insufferable dandy with two heads, three arms and half a brain, hijacked so he could search for the fabled planet Magrathea. The ancient Magratheans built a supercomputer (voiced by Helen Mirren) that spent 7.5 million years coming up with the answer that explains life, the universe and everything &#x2014; it's 42 &#x2014; and Zaphod hopes that by now it's come up with the question. His companions in questing are a desperately depressed android, Marvin (voiced by Alan Rickman), and Trillian, the girl (Zooey Deschanel) Arthur once tried to romance at a costume party but turned off with his boring, no-place-like-home attitude. The appeal of Adams'<i>Hitchhiker</i>books lies less in the narrative &#x2014; though Dent's adventures are often quite amusing &#x2014; than in the loopy digressions, a wildly imaginative mix of spacey science, navel-gazing noodling and a peculiarly English fatalism. Jennings opted to give the film an appealingly low-tech look and populated it with animatronic monsters designed by the Jim Henson Creature Shop and little Warwick Davis stoically shambling along inside the Marvin suit.  Driven equally by big questions and the abiding desire for small pleasures, like a decent cup of tea, it's an eccentric, mind-bending head trip that greets every catastrophe with an endearingly goofy smile that embodies<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>'s Zen mantra: Don't Panic!<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/hitchhikers-guide-galaxy/review/137900#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Lee grew up on fanciful tales</paragraph><paragraph>of martial arts chivalry (<i>wuxia pian</i>), filled with balletic,</paragraph><paragraph>gravity-defying action sequences, philosophical fighters and warrior women.</paragraph><paragraph>But he isn't interested in wringing ironic laughs from genre conventions. His</paragraph><paragraph>film (adapted from material by novelist Wang Du Lu) humanizes the formula by</paragraph><paragraph>emphasizing two love stories, one filled with youthful fire and the other</paragraph><paragraph>defined by mature melancholy. In ancient China, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat)</paragraph><paragraph>decides to abandon his fighting ways and asks fellow warrior Yu Shu Lien</paragraph><paragraph>(Michelle Yeoh) to present his cherished sword to respected elder Sir Te (Lung</paragraph><paragraph>Sihung). Shu Lien and Mu Bai love each other deeply, but tradition prevents</paragraph><paragraph>them from acting on their feelings. She agrees to take the sword and persuades</paragraph><paragraph>Mu Bai to meet her at Sir Te's Peking compound after he's paid tribute at the</paragraph><paragraph>grave of his master, murdered years earlier by mysterious bandit Jade Fox. The</paragraph><paragraph>sword is promptly stolen from Sir Te's home. The masked thief's identity is</paragraph><paragraph>quickly revealed: It's Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the beautiful teenage daughter of the</paragraph><paragraph>district's new governor. Jen, who will soon make a politically advantageous</paragraph><paragraph>marriage but secretly loves another, has been surreptitiously trained in the martial arts by her governess. And her governess is none other than the</paragraph><paragraph>elusive Jade Fox (<i>wuxia pian</i>veteran Cheng Pei Pei). While scrupulously</paragraph><paragraph>concerned with character relationships, Lee doesn't stint on the dreamlike</paragraph><paragraph>battle scenes, choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping and mercifully free of the</paragraph><paragraph>exaggerated sound effects familiar from exploitation kung fu pictures. The</paragraph><paragraph>combatants' fists and feet fly while they scuttle up walls, skim the surface</paragraph><paragraph>of water like insects and drift into the air like dandelion fluff (most</paragraph><paragraph>Western viewers first saw this style of martial arts action in THE MATRIX,</paragraph><paragraph>also choreographed by Yuen). The film satisfies on both visceral and emotional</paragraph><paragraph>levels, and showcases veterans Yeoh and Chow, as well as relative newcomers</paragraph><paragraph>Zhang and Chang Chen (who plays her bandit lover).<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/review/134505#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Set in a Gotham City suspended somewhere between America's past and a future that never was, it tells the story (or more accurately, given the variations spun by an assortment of comic book writers,<i>a</i>story) of fledgling prince-of-the-city Bruce Wayne's transformation into the haunted Batman. The key elements always remain the same, of course: Little Bruce (Gus Lewis), the much-loved son of wealthy, principled parents (Sara Stewart, Linus Roache), stews in the memory of their senseless murder until his psyche curdles. Raised to troubled manhood by the flinty family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), the adult Bruce Wayne's  (Christian Bale) thwarted thirst for vengeance drives him into the arms of martial-arts guru Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who in turn answers to shadow warrior Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). His education at their hands spawns a bold plan to rescue Gotham from its homegrown bad apples; bit by bit, Wayne channels his darkest impulses into a symbol of justice and order born of ninja stealth, carefully customized accessories developed for Wayne Enterprises' "applied science" (read: weapons) division and the nightmarish memory of a blinding twister of bats spewing from the mouth of a deep, dark cave. Nolan, Goyer and a top-flight cast and crew bring ambition, intelligence and craft to the table, combined with respectful knowledge of the Batman mythos. The result is handsome and logical, but missing the spark that would make it thrilling. Batman's story is grim, a Faustian fable of making deals with darkness in hopes of loosening its stranglehold on the world, but the moments when the backstory coalesces into iconic images and situations should tingle with exhilaration and satisfied recognition &#x2014; and they don't. That said, Bale burrows into Bruce Wayne's troubled mind with characteristic thoroughness, and the supporting cast is vivid proof that first-rate actors can enrich even broadly drawn characters. They include Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane, master of Arkham Asylum; Tom Wilkinson as thug Carmine Falcone; Gary Oldman as Commissioner-to-be Gordon; Rutger Hauer as shady CEO Richard Earle and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman's ally at Wayne Industries &#x2014; even the tiny role of a homeless man is brought up a notch by veteran actor Rade Sherbedgia. Only the game but outclassed Katie Holmes falls short as Batman's boyhood crush-turned-crusading district attorney.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/batman-begins/review/137932#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Practically from the moment of his assassination in 1978, people have been trying to get Milk's remarkable life story onto the screen, and thanks to Gus Van Sant and Sean Penn, it was worth the wait. The movie follows the final years of Milk's life, starting when he leaves New York with his partner, Scott Smith (James Franco), and opens a camera store in the now-famous Castro District of San Francisco. He faces bigotry based on his sexual orientation, but responds with serious action, spearheading a campaign of activism that organizes the gay community into a group with genuine financial strength -- a strength that Milk translates into political muscle. With his leadership, the community publicizes the unfair treatment often suffered at the hands of cops, who are occasionally physically abusive, and often can't be bothered to investigate the murders of gay men. All the while, Milk continues his attempts to win a seat on the city's Board of Supervisors, even as his devotion to politics leads to the breakdown of his relationship.</paragraph><paragraph>Dustin Lance Black's screenplay never holds Harvey Milk up as something bigger than he was -- he's never made into a martyr or a saint. He's a heroic, but complicated, three-dimensional person, and Sean Penn rises to the occasion with an empathetic performance that never rings false. He captures the charisma and drive that made Milk a born politician just as cannily as he does the flaws that made him a difficult life partner, and the intimate moments Milk shares with Smith are just as heartfelt as the scenes where he rallies thousands of angry protestors to march on city hall. Penn also gets expert support from everyone in the cast, especially Franco, who plays Smith's loyalty as unwavering, even when their relationship becomes so strained that he must move out. The film also benefits from a nuanced performance by Diego Luna, who plays Jack Lira, another longtime companion of Milk. Although Lira is a grandly flamboyant character, Luna never condescends to playing him as a drama queen -- his histrionics always seem to come from the character rather than from a stereotype. And Emile Hirsch shines as Cleve Jones, the brainy, energetic runaway who turns out to be Milk's political right-hand man.</paragraph><paragraph>Of course, director Gus Van Sant matches his lead actor's total commitment to the project. He doesn't shy away from the story's occasional stabs at operatic impact, but instead employs a recurring visual motif using mirrors and reflections to help these moments achieve maximum emotional effect. We see major and minor events transpire in mirrors, windows, and other items -- the most striking of which is an argument with a police officer viewed in the reflection of a metal whistle. This visual refrain, along with the measured but consistent use of opera on the soundtrack, helps make the ending an emotional powerhouse -- even though we know right from the start how Milk's life will end. Harvey Milk embodied the concept that "all politics is personal," and by presenting the famed Mayor of Castro Street's personal and public lives with such clarity and empathy, Van Sant has made something very rare in Hollywood -- a genuinely powerful political film that works equally well as a story of personal triumph.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/milk/review/295989#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Perry  Seibert</i>

It is 1932, the nadir of the Depression, and Cotten, a young painter who feels that his work lacks depth, sits glumly in</paragraph><paragraph>New York City's Central Park, contemplating his not-so-bright future. A beautiful young girl, Jones, approaches him and begins to speak with him, using strange words that belong to a previous era, mentioning that she attends a convent school and that her parents are trapeze artists at</paragraph><paragraph>Hammerstein's Opera House. She sings Cotten a haunting song, then disappears as abruptly as she appeared. Afterwards, Cotten struggles on with his art, encouraged by wealthy art dealer Barrymore, who takes a motherly interest in him, buying his water colors even though she knows they are poor, and</paragraph><paragraph>suggesting that he try a new medium. Jones turns up periodically throughout that winter, while Cotten finds work painting a mural on the wall of an Irish saloon, a commission arranged by Cotten's good friend Wayne, a cab driver. Each time Jones reappears through the following spring and summer,</paragraph><paragraph>she seems older by years, growing up from adolescence to young womanhood. Cotten asks her to sit for a portrait and finishes it just as she tells him she's about to graduate from college. When Barrymore and her associate, Kellaway, see the portrait of Jones, they hail it as a startling, innovative</paragraph><paragraph>work by the hitherto unpromising Cotten that will surely establish his artistic reputation. Yet Cotten is haunted by Jones and begins to look into her background, discovering that her parents were killed in a highwire accident. Moreover, he finds out from Gish, the mother superior at an all-girl</paragraph><paragraph>college, that Jones was in fact killed during a hurricane in New England in the 1920s. Cotten refuses to believe that the girl he painted is a ghost, but on the eve of the hurricane's anniversary, he rushes to New England. There, Jones comes to him during a raging storm and tells him that their</paragraph><paragraph>love will live across the barriers of time, then vanishes for good. Eventually, Cotten begins to doubt he ever really met the beautiful girl, but when he finds her scarf, he begins to believe that he will meet his true love again in the afterlife after all.</paragraph><paragraph>Dieterle's direction is sensitive and the sequences are wonderfully constructed, with no scene bruising the next. He draws forth stellar performances, especially from Cotten; Jones is seen too briefly, but projects a genuinely ethereal quality during her moments on the screen. August's photography</paragraph><paragraph>is stunning, and Tiomkin's lyrical score, drawn from Claude Debussy's themes (principally "The Afternoon of a Faun") is highly memorable. The foreword of the film, written by Ben Hecht, sums up the story's effect: "Out of the shadows of knowledge, and out of a painting that hung on a museum wall,</paragraph><paragraph>comes our story, the truth of which lies not on our screen but in your heart." (A similar story of love that crosses mortal boundaries is at the core of a Hecht romance of considerable note, MIRACLE IN THE RAIN.)<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/portrait-jennie/review/109467#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

It's in movie comedies that Disney is having its real crisis, as evidenced by this would-be laugh-getter that begins with the murder of a child and a triple hanging.</paragraph><paragraph>In 1693 Salem, Massachusetts, three witch-sisters--Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy)--are hanged after killing a little girl to prolong their own lives and turning her brother into Binx, a talking black cat doomed to live for eternity. Cut to</paragraph><paragraph>Halloween, 1993. Newly moved with his family from LA, teenager Max (Omri Katz) is having trouble adjusting. He gets shouted down in class, flirted with and then ignored by sexy classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw). His offense in class was snorting at the tale of the three local legendary witches.</paragraph><paragraph>Allison worked at the witches' house, which had been preserved and turned into a museum, now closed.</paragraph><paragraph>Max gets beaten up by local bullies and then browbeaten into taking his bratty sister Dani (Thora Birch) trick-or-treating. When they stumble into Allison's house, she's warmer to Max and takes him up on a challenge to prove the truth of the witch story by breaking into their house. There, Max</paragraph><paragraph>tempts fate by lighting a black-flame candle that brings the witches to life for Halloween night only, unless they can find new youngsters to kill, with Dani the leading candidate. Helped by Binx, who has lived at the house since the spell was cast, they thwart the witches and watch them turn to</paragraph><paragraph>dust with dawn's first light.</paragraph><paragraph>HOCUS POCUS on paper would seem to have everything going for it, with three top screen comediennes in the leading roles, a potentially interesting idea for a film in which to star them, and eye-catching, ingenious special effects. Producer David Kirschner has a special knack in the latter area.</paragraph><paragraph>His major credits include the CHILD'S PLAY series and AN AMERICAN TAIL. His key critter creation here is Binx, who is so seamlessly and fluidly executed that it's virtually impossible to tell where the real cat leaves off and the special effects take over. However, it's indicative of the film's</paragraph><paragraph>problems that he never has much of a part to play.</paragraph><paragraph>Under direction that can only be described as scatterbrained by choreographer-turned-director Kenny Ortega (NEWSIES), HOCUS POCUS runs off in so many directions at once that it keeps tripping over itself behind a plot that doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Binx is trapped under a spell</paragraph><paragraph>cast by the dead witches that can only be broken by bringing the witches back to life and killing them again. Before you can say, "Run that by me again?", Binx is forgotten, and the film is dashing off into another nonsensical direction. The witches, having been brought back to life, cast a spell</paragraph><paragraph>over all the children of Salem so they can kill them for revenge. Having done that, however, they then spend the film's last half hour risking everything to get Dani, as if she were the only child in Salem. Add the fatally mixed moods--how funny can child-killers be, even if they are played by</paragraph><paragraph>three of the screen's top comediennes?--and the only possible result is certain failure.  Or HOCUS POCUS, which even uncredited cameos by director-siblings Garry and Penny Marshall, cleverly cast as husband and wife, can't save. Parker comes close to making the film watchable with the role of the</paragraph><paragraph>simplest sister, an airhead to end all airheads with a body built for evil and the attention span of a Pekingese. Put her and the talking cat together, and you might have a pretty good film.<i>(Adult situations, violence.)</i>

Granted, Jones offers little more than another rehash of his no-nonsense FUGITIVE persona &#x97; and a pretty lazy one at that &#x97; but he's still entertaining enough to float the rest of the movie. Just as Texas Ranger Roland Sharp (Jones) and his partner, Margaret Swanson (Liz Vassey), are closing in on Morgan Ball (Curtis Armstrong), a potential key witness in a government case, everything goes wrong: Swanson is badly wounded and Ball shot to death in a back alley. The murder was witnessed &#x97; in a manner of speaking &#x97; by five University of Texas cheerleaders who just happened to be catching a bit of fresh air at an open window. Granted, they can't agree on what the shooter looked like (except that he had really bad hair), but they saw enough to be considered potential targets of retaliation. To ensure their protection, Sharp agrees to move into the squad's spacious house and pose as their new assistant cheerleading coach. Of course the concrete-faced, no-fun Ranger's personality is the very antithesis of pep, hence the occasionally funny comedic situations that ensue. The girls don't intend to let themselves be pushed around by a man old enough to be their father and mean enough to confiscate their cell phones, so the arrangement quickly turns into a contest of wills. Even if the girls weren't exactly what you'd expect &#x97; Barb (Kelli Garner) is really dumb, Evie (Monica Keena) is really smart; squad captain Anne (Christina Milian) is really bossy, fiery Latina Therese (Paula Garces) is really temperamental and tough-gal Heather (Vanessa Ferlito) is the predictable wild card &#x97; their misadventures are. They get into a bar fight, give the nervous Sharp a makeover before his date with an English professor (Anne Archer), teach him how to reach out to his 17-year-old daughter (Shannon Marie Woodward) and, yes, use their pyramid-building skills to catch the bad guy. And if you can't figure out who<i>that</i>is the minute he first appears, you've either seen too few movies with mind-numbingly predictable plots or you've seen far too many.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/man-house/review/137851#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

On a dark and stormy night in 1944, American GIs led by high-strung British occultist professor Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm (Kevin Trainor) disrupt a ceremony designed to open an inter-dimensional portal and jump-start the apocalypse. Who would want to do such a thing? The usual suspects: undead Russian mystic Rasputin (Karel Roden), she-wolf Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), zombie assassin Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and a scrum of occult-obsessed Nazis. The portal is closed but a little cherry-red demon with an oversized stone arm has already come through; the Yanks dub him "Hellboy" and Broom raises him like a son. In the present day, newly graduated young FBI agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) reports for his first assignment at what appears to be a waste-management facility in Newark, N.J. It's actually the ultra-top-secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, run by the aging professor (John Hurt) and manned by the now-grown Hellboy, a psychic merman named Abe Sapiens (Doug Jones, voiced by David Hyde Pierce) and a flock of highly expendable human agents. Another of Broom's talented freaks, conflicted fire-starter Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), recently committed herself to a mental facility, devastating the besotted Hellboy and leaving him in no mood to warm to a new minder, the post Myers has been handed. Summoned to investigate a break-in at the Machen Library, where six guards lie dead and an ancient artifact shattered, Hellboy quickly traces the lingering nasty vibe to a writhing bit of self-replicating grotesquerie summoned up by Rasputin, Ilsa and Kroenen, who are back to finish what they started 60 years earlier. Writer-director Guillermo del Toro's adaptation of the first story cycle in graphic novelist Mike Mignola's<i>Hellboy</i>series is gloomily gorgeous, but its tone careens recklessly between light comedy and dark portentousness and the character relationships suffer. Hellboy's love for the troubled Liz, which should be a heartbreaker, is undermined by his played-for-laughs jealousy of Myers; the yin-yang interplay between fastidious, cultured Abe and hardboiled Hellboy is underdeveloped; and the bond between Hellboy and the professor never feels as intense as it's clearly meant to be. Arguing that you shouldn't expect rich characterization from a comic-book movie misses the point: Vivid relationships separate the graphic novels from the funnies and, in the end, spectacular set design is just window dressing.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/hellboy/review/137369#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

And rightfully so. But while grateful for the history lesson, one wishes Lee's clunky adaptation of James McBride's celebrated novel was a much better movie.</paragraph><paragraph>New York City, 1983. At a Harlem post office, an elderly, bespectacled clerk inexplicably shoots a man after he asks to purchase a 20-cent stamp. The gun the clerk uses is a WWII-era German Luger. Baffled, Detective Tony Ricci (John Turturro) orders his men to search the killer's apartment where they find a Purple Heart and the head of the 450-year-old marble<i>Primavera</i>that once stood on Florence's Ponte Santa Trinita before the bridge was destroyed by German troops. Intrigued, cub reporter Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) visits the shooter in the psych ward and convinces him to tell the story behind the Primavera's long-missing head -- and why he murdered a man in cold-blood.</paragraph><paragraph>Tuscany, Italy, 1944. After a disastrous attempt to cross the Serchio River that wends its way along the Gothic Line where deeply entrenched German troops have been battling Italian Partisan guerilla fighters, four black soldiers of the 92nd Infrantry Division find themselves stranded on the wrong side. Their predicament is largely the result of bigoted Lt. Claussen's (Ralph Palka) refusal to take seriously the word of "waiters and shoeshine boys" concerning their position, and now they're stuck with no way to go but forward. By the time Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), Sergeant Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), Puerto-Rican Corporal Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) and hulking Pfc Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) reach the tiny Tuscan village of Colognora, their ranks also include Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi), the 8-year-old survivor of a terrible atrocity at the nearby village of St. Anna. For the past three years, Colognora has been under siege and most of the villagers -- with the exception of the fascist Ludovico (veteran Italian actor Omero Antonutti) -- are thrilled to see the Americans, regardless of their race. Angelo needs medical attention but as Ludovico's daughter, Renata (Omero Antonutti), warns them, the region is infested with German troops who are vigilantly searching for an AWOL German solider (Jan Pohl) and the renowned Partisan fighter Peppi Grotta (Pierfrancesco Favino), known locally as the "The Great Butterfly." And even if the way were clear, they're ordered to stay put by Lt. Claussen with whom they finally make radio contact. Claussen also orders them to capture and hold a German prisoner for interrogation, but soon after their job is done for them when Peppi and his fellow fighters arrive in Colognora with the AWOL POW in tow. Angelo, however, recognizes them both from what occurred at St. Anna.</paragraph><paragraph>This is first Lee's first attempt at a war epic, but it feels like it's his very first film: What should have been an eloquent answer to the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- with whom Lee justly took to task over the total absence of any black soldiers in THE FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS -- is instead a patchy war-time drama that only catches fire when it deals directly with Bishop's and Staples' conflicting views on what it means to risk their lives serving a country that still considers them no better than second-class citizens. The rest is filled with tin-ear dialogue, ham-fisted montage (they may be enemies, but they all pray to a Christian God), unintentionally laughable images, an amateurishly staged final shootout and inexplicable lapses. In a lengthy early scene, John Leguizamo is introduced as an American art dealer in Rome, but is never seen again. His total absence would have at least made this overlong film feel slightly shorter.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/miracle-st-anna/review/294292#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

Combined with Meryl Streep's outstanding performance as elegant virago Miranda Priestly, editrix extraordinare, the acid-tipped sliver of truth tucked into the flutter and frippery gives the comedy a chill that lingers longer than the small, knowing snickers. Fresh out of Northwestern University and convinced her future lies in serious journalism, coltish but unpolished Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) lucks into the job "a million girls would die for": second assistant to the imperious queen bee of "Runway" magazine. Miranda is the "ne plus ultra" of bad bosses, ruthlessly selfish, mercurial, imperious, insanely demanding and just plain cruel. "Runway" staffers live in terror of her excoriating rages and scatter at the click-click-click sound of lethal stilettos in the hall, as though laser-eyed Miranda were capable of looking right through their cutting-edge frocks to pass judgment on plebeian panties. Andrea is found lacking on every level, from her schlubby sweaters to her tacky nickname &#x2014;<i>Andy</i>, if you can<i>imagine</i>&#x2014; and woeful ignorance of the semiotics of cerulean (and she thinks she's so smart!). Oh, and she's fat &#x2014; at "Runway," a lanky size 6 is a full-blown chubbette. Andy learns the biz, with a little help &#x2014; a very little help, truth be told &#x2014; from Miranda's right-hand flunky, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), and hollow-eyed first-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt), but as her wardrobe grows trendier, her soul withers, pickled in a stew of hunger, celebrity worship and label addiction. Briskly directed by<i>Sex and the City</i>veteran David Frankel, the movie is far better than the source, which was Lauren Weisberger's clunky, thinly fictionalized tale of her ordeal by<i>Vogue</i>editor Anna "Nuclear" Wintour. The trouble isn't that it's chick lit &#x2014; Jane Austen wrote chick lit &#x2014; but that it's a shallow compendium of brand names and whining. Streep is the answer to what ails it: Her magnificently nuanced Miranda is a monster of monumental proportions, across whose face ghostly glimpses of a fully realized person who<i>made</i>herself horrible flicker briefly. The sheer force of Streep's performance pulls the talented Hathaway up, and the bitter truth beneath the feathers, silk and sequins is simply that everyone pays for ambition, but dragon ladies pay double at the door.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/devil-wears-prada/review/280965#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

This makes enough sense if you think about it: the great equalizer of CGI has changed the playing field, and there's no longer a feeling of grandness in the casts of thousands and exotic locales that once made movies like<i>The Ten Commandments</i>and<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>live up to their classification. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's still a shame -- at least in the case of Baz Luhrmann's 2008 film<i>Australia</i>, which is, in the classic sense of the word, epic.</paragraph><paragraph>An ode to Luhrmann's home country,<i>Australia</i>takes place during the early days of World War II -- a historical setting that, as in all good WWII movies, brews in the background until the third act, when stuff starts to blow up. The film opens with the prim and proper (but very ballsy) Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) defying all early-'40s conventions by ditching her aristocratic British estate to collect her skirt-chasing husband from a cattle station they own in the Australian outback. Said husband arranges to have the lady escorted from port to ranch by a cattle drover (Hugh Jackman), who goes by the creative nickname Drover. The cavalier Aussie takes Lady Ashley on a three-day ride through the desert en route to the station, and of course along the way, he shocks her left and right with his rough-and-tumble style -- as well as his egalitarian attitude toward the native people, who live in your basic state of colonial impoverished subjugation.</paragraph><paragraph>Sarah's journey gets more complicated after they arrive at the cattle station, but it would take way too long to explain the rest of the plot, as the film clocks in at over two and a half hours. Basically, there's an evil, monopolizing cattle company, a beautiful orphaned Aboriginal child, a massive cattle drive by a few ragtag wranglers, a world war, an island full of children in danger, and Hugh Jackman with his shirt off. And yes, somewhere along the way, Sarah and Drover teach each other how to love again. The opposites-attract premise may sound old and stale, but it works perfectly here, where a less tried-and-true romantic formula would have just been confusing amid the rest of the sweeping story -- which spans years. In fact, it should probably be said that one of the reasons<i>Australia</i>works so well is that the story at its core is simple and solid. The enormous scale of the film's vision is what pushes that simple story toward moments of greatness, but it could still survive on its own as a romantic drama if it had to.</paragraph><paragraph>It doesn't have to, though; Australia goes for the absolute limit in terms of scope. And let's not be coy -- size may not matter, but it still helps. The majesty of vast desert landscapes splaying out into the distant edges of the frame remind you every few minutes that this harsh, enigmatic, brutally gorgeous continent really is like nowhere else on earth. Luhrmann is also completely unabashed when it comes to weaving in themes about the tragically squandered beauty of Aboriginal culture. He dives headlong into his celebration of Australia's native peoples -- complete with their strange singing, their half-nakedness, and any other attribute likely to sit uneasily with cigar-chomping studio execs and corn-fed test audiences. And his commitment to the theme pays off -- even when that skinny elder tribesman pops up out of nowhere like Jim Morrison's imaginary Indian in Oliver Stone's<i>The Doors</i>, you're still totally on board, still believing in the magic, and still paying attention after 160 (very epic) minutes.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/australia/review/292576#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila  Albertson</i>

Rudd has been stealing the show in comedies for years, showing up to briefly spike the laughs-per-minute ratio in everything from Apatow flicks to Will Ferrell vehicles, but seeing him take the lead is truly gratifying -- and, more importantly, funny. Seann William Scott (still known mainly as Stiffler from<i>American Pie</i>) actually does a more than adequate job of playing the number two in this buddy film as well, taking on his usual role of the simple, horny creature with a crappy post-college apartment and a zillion creative ways to talk about boobies. In this case, this creature comes in the form of a guy named Wheeler, who tours around with Danny to speaking engagements wearing a big, puffy minotaur costume. He pretty much likes the gig, but Danny gets steadily more and more despondent over the lack of meaning in his life, and eventually tells an auditorium full of middle-schoolers to stem the tide of life's unyielding mediocrity and get started on hard drugs good and early. Then he and Wheeler crash the Minotaur-mobile into a statue of a horse.</paragraph><paragraph>Danny's lawyer and recent ex-girlfriend, Beth (played by Elizabeth Banks, the go-to girl for seemingly every comedy made since the start of the millennium), manages to get the guys out of serving jail time by reducing their sentence to 150 hours of community service, which the judge stipulates must be carried out at Sturdy Wings, a Big Brothers-type organization that partners problem kids with guiding older pals. Of course, Danny ends up with a fantasy-obsessed, live-action role-playing kid named Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, hopefully still known mainly as McLovin' -- for the rest of his life) and Wheeler gets Ronnie, the quintessential angry black 11-year-old (played by Bobb'e J. Thompson, a kid who spews such earnest and authentic profanity that you'd swear he's really a 30-year-old with one of those Gary Coleman-type growth disorders). The premise is simple enough, but the execution is comedy gold. It doesn't try to push the envelope or bury a bunch of pretentious subtext under the humor, it just hands the idea over to the creative folks on either side of the camera and lets them whip it into a mile-high pile of spot-on jokes about D&amp;D nerds, relatively clever dick jokes, and kick-ass running character gags (read: Jane Lynch).</paragraph><paragraph>The story does eventually succumb to the now<i>de rigeur</i>standard of throwing in a sappy, guileless happy ending to compensate for the rest of the movie's balls-out vulgarity, but it doesn't feel any more shoehorned in here than it does anywhere else. In fact, the underlying mushiness in<i>Role Models</i>otherwise pops up in the movie in really delightful ways, like the storyline about role-playing dorks. The movie makes fun of their costumes and PVC swords, but in the end, it's totally sympathetic -- even celebratory -- about a bunch of kids doing what makes them happy. The heroes might storm the climactic battle in somewhat unorthodox outfits (which it would be a crime to spoil), but by this point, they've won you over with plenty of crudeness and satire and sodomy jokes. And besides, it's fun to play pretend. After all, that's why we go to movies in the first place.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/role-models/review/295819#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila Albertson</i>

Part of what makes this classic film so remarkable is that these questions are never answered directly--an oddity for a</paragraph><paragraph>product of Hollywood where loose ends are rarely allowed. This is the ultimate cult film for the new Hollywood. It is quoted and alluded to in numerous films such as HARDCORE, TAXI DRIVER, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and STAR WARS.</paragraph><paragraph>As THE SEARCHERS begins, we hear the extraordinarily beautiful strains of Max Steiner's score over darkness. A cabin door opens to reveal the harsh beauty of the arid Monument Valley in the distance. The silhouette of a frontier woman moves into the doorway. Far beyond we see a tiny figure on</paragraph><paragraph>horseback approaching. "Ethan?" queries the woman uncertainly. The figure dismounts and walks toward the house. The woman is Martha Edwards (Dorothy Jordan), the wife of Ethan's brother. She is joined on the porch by her husband, Aaron (Walter Coy), their teenaged daughter, Lucy (Pippa Scott),</paragraph><paragraph>10-year-old Debbie (Lana Wood), and teenaged Ben (Robert Lyden). Ethan's clothes are filthy and he wears a faded Confederate coat. The children chant "Uncle Ethan! Uncle Ethan!" Ethan Edwards has finally come home--three years after the end of the Civil War.</paragraph><paragraph>John Wayne gives the performance of his career as Ethan Edwards, one of the most intriguing characters the American cinema has given us. Ethan is a mysterious obsessive man who rides in from the wastelands of Monument Valley into a small frontier farm settled by his brother years earlier. He has</paragraph><paragraph>been missing since the end of the Civil War in which he fought for the Confederacy. He never turned up at the surrender to give up his sword and saber. He is also inexplicably carrying a large quantity of gold and, in the words of the local captain of the Texas Rangers, Reverend Samuel Clayton</paragraph><paragraph>(Ward Bond), Ethan "fits a lot of descriptions."</paragraph><paragraph>The last family member to arrive is Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter). Now nearly grown, Martin was saved years ago by Ethan when his parents were slaughtered by Indians. Ethan left him in the care of Aaron, who has raised him as his own son, but because Martin is one-eighth Cherokee, Ethan now</paragraph><paragraph>treats him as a boarder rather than as one of the family.</paragraph><paragraph>The tranquility of the Edwards' lives is shattered when the local Commanche tribe goes on the warpath. Most of the men are lured away from the farm and the Edwards' farm is attacked. Most of the family is brutally murdered and the two daughters are abducted. The men form a search party and go off</paragraph><paragraph>in hot pursuit. The ravaged body of the older girl is found and buried while the search for Debbie continues. When the winter snows come, most of the men turn back. Ethan is undaunted by this temporary setback. He and Martin resolve to continue the search and they do--for seven years. As the</paragraph><paragraph>months drag on, Martin is amazed by Ethan's knowledge of the Indians' ways and his ability to read their signs and speak their language, but comes to realize that his guide is also a fanatical racist who intends to kill Debbie when they find her because she has become a "squaw."</paragraph><paragraph>THE SEARCHERS is an extremely rich film that continues to reveal new nuances with each viewing. The genre's traditional opposition between "Civilization" and "Wilderness" has rarely been as powerfully represented dramatically or visually. Ethan sees himself as an agent of civilization but his</paragraph><paragraph>skills ally him with the forces of wilderness. He can find nowhere where he can be at peace and accepted. His difficulty in accepting a Native American as part of his family mirrors America's tensions regarding civil rights and integration in the 1950s. In a genre that has often be justly</paragraph><paragraph>condemned for its racism, THE SEARCHERS--while hardly politically correct by modern standards--was a major breakthrough for Ford, Wayne, and the genre. The traditional Western hero and the Cavalry is shown in an unusually critical light. Furthermore the Native American point of view is considered</paragraph><paragraph>for a change. By balancing points of view, Ford deepens and informs our understanding of the story. Equally well managed is the film's balance of drama and humor. THE SEARCHERS is essentially a tragedy, and without its humorous passages the film would have been almost too grim to bear (as was Alan</paragraph><paragraph>LeMay's novel). The humor grows out of and illuminates character; even the hard-driven Ethan reveals a sense of irony and wit.</paragraph><paragraph>Ford's poetic visual sensibility has never been more richly demonstrated. The film provides an opportunity for numerous striking portraits of John Wayne set against the western vistas in color and widescreen. If you had to pick an ultimate Western still, it would probably come from this film. THE</paragraph><paragraph>SEARCHERS is also that rare sound film in which more is revealed through facial expression, physical stance, and subtle gesture than through dialogue. Deep and complex insights into characters are all beautifully conveyed by body language. All in all, this is about as good as Hollywood filmmaking</paragraph><paragraph>gets. A deeply emotional experience that is also a grand entertainment, THE SEARCHERS is a true American masterpiece.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/searchers/review/117046#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

He's working  at a Chicago copy shop when he's abruptly called home for Ethan's funeral. After the inevitable run in with his dad, who clearly thinks the wrong son was run down by a truck, Ethan returns home to find his bank account crammed with cash, his apartment piled high with military gear and a strange woman on his cell phone, telling him to do as he's told or he'll be arrested as a terrorist. Jerry is still waffling when the FBI's counter-terrorist unit kicks in his door . While Jerry is being sweated by Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton), Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is spending a night on the town with her girlfriends. A single mother, Rachel has just put her eight-year-old, Sam (Cameron Boyce), on a train to Washington DC, where his school band is going to play at the Kennedy Center, and is enjoying her first break in ages. She too gets a call from the same female stranger, telling her that if she fails to follow directions, Sam will die. The stranger engineers Jerry's escape and throws him together with Rachel, now driving a spiffy Porsche Cayenne, and the race is on. Can Rachel and Jerry figure out who's pulling their strings and what they're being manipulated into doing before Morgan catches up to them?</paragraph><paragraph>A string of elaborate and utterly unbelievable stunts sequences wrapped around a tangle of timely concerns &#x2013; the roots of terrorism, the price of big-brother surveillance, the pitfalls of super-technologies and the question of who should decide where a nation's best interests lie &#x2013; this big-budget thriller's tenuous claim to torn-from-today's headlines believability hinges on whether you buy the identity of the mysterious caller, which is revealed halfway through the film. Suffice it to say that the Forbin Project got there first, and more convincingly.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/eagle-eye/review/295228#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Orphaned 17-year-old Rashad Swann (rapper Tip "T.I." Harris) is shouldering more responsibility than most high-school students. He and his 15-year-old brother, Ant (Evan Ross, son of Motown legend Diana Ross), live with their Uncle George (Mykelti Williamson), who never lets them forget that he kept them out of foster care and assumed their parents' mortgage. After school, Rashad and Ant "help" George clean offices, which actually means<i>they</i>clean while George trims his toenails at some unsuspecting cubicle-slave's desk. Smart, disciplined and serious, Rashad secretly dreams of becoming a comic-strip artist, but looking out for Ant, a restless, indifferent student who's dangerously vulnerable to the cash-and-flash posturing of local dealer Marcus (Antwan Andre Patton, Outkast's Big Boi), eats up much of his time and energy. Rashad lives for Sunday nights at Cascade, where he and his friends are stars in the firmament of the local skate scene. Loyal, good-natured Brooklyn (Albert Daniels) is the clown of the group, while ambitious Esquire (Jackie Long), who worked the system to get into an exclusive public school, works at the local country club and hopes to attend an Ivy League college. But the finances are daunting and he needs a stellar letter of recommendation from the kind of influential pillar of the community no one in his crowd knows. High-school dropout Teddy (Jason Weaver), who keeps quiet about his age but is clearly older than the others, lives with his mom and fits "grills" &#x2014; gold and gem-studded dental caps &#x2014; at a local strip mall. And then there's ghetto-fabulous roller girl New-New (Lauren London), the best thing that's happened to Rashad in years and not at all what she seems; for all her weaves and door-knocker earrings, she's actually the pampered daughter of wealthy businessman John Garnett (Keith David). Grittier than the sweetly nostalgic, '70s-era ROLL BOUNCE (2005), this character-driven ensemble piece has the same sense of optimism and pulses with contemporary hip-hop rhythms. The story is familiar, but terrific performances and a vivid sense of place elevate it above the average teen-oriented picture.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/atl/review/279401#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Self-taught, first-time writer/director Troy Duffy, a 26-year-old New Hampshire native, snagged a sweet one with Miramax on the basis of his virtriolic "sick</paragraph><paragraph>fantasy" (his words) script, inspired by one glimpse too many of L.A. lowlife. The story was that not only would Duffy direct the picture on location in Boston, but his band would do the music<i>and</i>Miramax would buy the bar where he'd been working and give Duffy partial ownership. Next thing</paragraph><paragraph>you know, Patrick Swayze and Stephen Dorff were cast and Paramount was stepping in with a tempting offer for Duffy's<i>next</i>two projects. Then the Miramax deal collapsed, leaving Duffy to shoot in Toronto with indie financing; slated for theatrical release, the finished film slipped into</paragraph><paragraph>video stores with less fanfare than some degenerate POLTERGEIST sequel. What a dramatic arc! Now, to the movie: Boston-based, working-class, Irish Catholic brothers Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus), who mysteriously speak five languages and sport "veritas" and</paragraph><paragraph>"aequitas" ("truth" and "justice") tattoos on their hands, kill a pair of Russian mafiosi in self-defense and under utterly bizarre circumstances. The local cops are baffled by the crime scene, but gay, New York-based  FBI agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe, in one of the worst performances of his</paragraph><paragraph>career) waltzes in, figures out what must have happened and fingers Connor and Murphy. The siblings, meanwhile, decide they've been called by God to wash the scum off the streets and embark on an increasingly baroque, vigilante killing spree. Smecker, always one step behind, begins to wonder</paragraph><paragraph>whether he should just let them take out the bad guys. Duffy's models are clearly snarky, ultraviolent Tarantino-esque crime pictures, but this movie's cleverness is never quite on a par with its bloodlust.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/boondock-saints/review/134582#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Even the title &#x2014; a play on New Hampshire's notoriously belligerent state motto &#x2014; doesn't make a lick of sense. But it sounds<i>cool</i>, and that's what counts. We last saw blue-collar cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) giving a cackling German terrorist what-for in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (1995), and 12 years later he's older, crankier and a lot less gung ho about hurling himself into the fray. But somebody's gotta do what a man's gotta do, and McClane is the man.</paragraph><paragraph>It's July 3 and the FBI needs help rounding up the usual hackers, including scruffy, authority-hating smartass Matt Farrell (Justin Long). All McClane has to do is drive Matt to D.C. and hand him off &#x2014; simple stuff until the bullets and insanely athletic baddies (including French<i>parkour-iste</i>Cyril Raffaelli) start flying. "Is the circus in town?" McClane howls. Well,<i>yeah</i>, complete with incredible flying cars, heavily armed acrobats, a high-kicking kung-fu cutie, a black-clad ringmaster orchestrating Armageddon for fun and profit, and a blue-suited swarm of government clowns whose impotent efforts to contain the spreading disaster provide the film's easy laughs. By the time McClane and the geek reach Washington, chaos is unfolding: Someone is systematically disabling or shutting down air-traffic control systems, the street-light and electrical grids of major cities, and the country's telecommunications network. "It's a fire sale," whispers the awestruck Matt, a total shut-down, and he unwittingly helped it along when he wrote that mutating encryption program for an anonymous, sultry-voiced employer. With federal agencies blundering around like drunken monkeys, it falls to McClane &#x2014; an analog weapon in a digital war &#x2014; and his reluctant sidekick to find the man behind the pandemonium. Their quarry: former government-security expert Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who, in the wake of 9/11, advised his bosses that America was pathetically vulnerable to computer terrorism and was repaid with total career ruin. And we all know what happens next: McClane blows stuff up (notably the helicopter he takes out with a fire hydrant and a stolen cop-car-turned-flaming-missile), battles the kung-fu cutie (Maggie Q) in an SUV that's hanging down an elevator shaft, goes mano a mano with a fighter jet, and pursues Thomas, who's not only tried to short-circuit America into the Stone Age but also had the audacity to kidnap McClane's estranged daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).</paragraph><paragraph>Directed by propman turned filmmaker Len Wiseman (UNDERWORLD), it's brainlessly exhilarating until the fighter-jet scene, at which point the high-octane idiocy becomes too preposterous to bear... and there's still a solid half hour to go.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/live-free-die-hard/review/288733#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

When it's also a pretty sharp, knowingly excessive satire of the industry that churns them out.</paragraph><paragraph>"Tropic Thunder" -- ImagiCorp studio's adaptation of 'Nam hero John "Four Leaf" Tayback's (Nick Nolte) POW memoir that's currently being shot on location in Vietnam -- is already way over-budget and a month behind schedule, even though the film has only been in production for five days. The film's rookie director, Brit Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), blames his ensemble of ego-clashing, out-of-control stars and their inability to take direction for the sinking of the whole project. Damien's star is Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also cowrote and directed), an actor of obviously limited talent whose once-popular, now ludicrous "Scorcher" action franchise has clearly run out of gas. Tugg's previous foray into drama, the embarrassingly bad "Simple Jack," in which he played an intellectually challenged man who can talk to animals, has recently been voted worst movie. Ever. Speedman's costar is Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), the Australian actor whose commitment to his craft has lead him to take on such "risky," Oscar-grabbing roles as a gay monk in Fox Searchlight's bold "Satan's Alley," as well as undergo a number of startling physical transformations: For "Tropic Thunder," Kirk has gone through a controversial "pigmentation alteration" procedure that has essentially transformed his face into that of an African-American man, albeit one who talks and acts like Carl Weathers in FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE. And making their debut as "serious" actors are two personalities not known for their acting chops: Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a drug-addicted, gross-out comedian who single-handedly played an entire overweight, flatulent family in the popular comedy "Fatties" ("Fatties: Fart 2" is already in the can, so to speak), and rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) who, in addition to movies, is also branching out into the beverage market with his Booty Sweat energy drink. After he is chewed a brand-new rear orifice by ImagiCorp's Scott Rudin-esque chief Les Grossman (Tom Cruise, virtually unrecognizable in makeup and padding), Damien takes a note from "Four Leaf" himself: Cockburn air-lifts himself, his four leads -- plus newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) -- into a remote valley where they'll have no choice but to follow his direction. There he'll shoot the rest of the movie guerilla style, having already rigged the thick jungle with small cameras and remote-controlled explosives courtesy of pyromaniacal special-effects whiz Cody (Danny McBride). What Damian doesn't realize until it's too late is that the location he's chosen is dangerously close to the notorious Golden Triangle where heroin producing poppies are farmed -- and fiercely protected -- by heavily armed guard who assume these costumed actors are U.S. DEA agents. Within moments of landing war breaks out, and the cast of "Tropic Thunder" finds itself in the middle of a very real firefight with some very real bullets.</paragraph><paragraph>Written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Mike Judge cohort Etan Cohen, the film opens with a brilliant conceit: The three main actors are introduced via a hilarious series of fake trailers for their latest movies, while Alpa Chino appears in an ad for Booty Sweat. The movie is funniest when it sticks closest to Hollywood satire, skewering back-lot sized egos and the movie cliches that it also delivers, only with tongue obviously in cheek. The set-up is a little incoherent and like the movies spoofed it all gets to be a bit too much. But a lot of the film looks great and is pretty funny. Downey is particularly good as a serious actor who refuses to break character until he does the DVD commentary, and Cruise is downright scary. It's the creepiest -- and most entertaining -- performance since his unforgettable appearance in that Scientology video.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/tropic-thunder/review/293507#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

The sequel is a live-action Road Runner cartoon, which is a criticism to the degree that you think story, characterization and some fidelity (no matter how tenuous) to the laws of gravity are important. Man in Black-and-White Frank Martin (Statham), a former special-ops agent turned "transporter" for hire, has taken an unlikely temporary gig chauffeuring the small son (Hunter Clary) of Miami-based drug czar Billings  (Matthew Modine) and his unhappy wife, Audrey (Amber Valletta, whose transition from modeling to acting is more a matter of terminology than fact). When the boy is kidnapped, Frank suspects there's more to the matter than ransom money, and sets about figuring out what the child's abductors are up to, even as the FBI predicates its investigation on the assumption that he was in on the crime. Frank is right, of course; Russian scientists, Colombian narcotics cartels, a bio-engineered virus and an upcoming conference of antidrug officials from around the world are involved. Frank is forced to go head to head against oily mercenary Gianni (Alessandro Gassman, whose father, veteran actor Vittorio, was know as "the Italian Laurence Olivier") and gun-slinging, skanky scanties-clad &#xFC;berbitch Lola (model Katie Nauta), who performs miraculous feats of acrobatic mayhem in sky-high heels. His only allies are Audrey and his old friend, small-town French police inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand, reprising his role from the first film), who had the misfortune to choose this weekend to vacation in Florida. Things blow up, cars fly, jet skis sail down highways and international disaster is averted, no thanks to the boneheaded bumbling of federal and local law enforcement. If not precisely charismatic, Statham brings authentic athleticism and a certain cheeky presence to his lightly written role. The film's relation to physical reality is epitomized by the scene in which Frank drives off a pier, executes a graceful mid-air barrel that scrapes off the explosive stuck to his car's undercarriage on the edge of a dangling crane hook, then lands on the other side of the inlet and speeds off. If you enjoy watching other people play high-end-video driving games, it doesn't get much better than that.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/transporter-2/review/192202#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Screw the book &#x97; Detroit detective Orin Boyd (Steven Seagal) believes in results, and we first see his cowboy style in action as he rescues the Vice President (Chris Lawford) from white supremacist militiamen disguised as cops. Unfortunately, he defies an explicit Secret Service order not to get involved and shoves the VP into a river to get him out of harm's way. We've come a long way since Dirty Harry incurred the wrath of<i>his</i>superiors for similar hijinks: Harry was never forced to attend anger-management therapy. Reassigned to the worst precinct in town, Boyd realizes in short order that it's crawling with dirty cops, notably cocky Detective Montini (David Vadim) and his pals, who are in cahoots with drug dealer Lattrell Walker (rapper DMX). Boyd is certain they're behind the theft of $5 million worth of heroin from a police storage facility. Abetted by his new partner, straight-arrow George Clark (Isaiah Washington), Boyd declares a private war on the bad cops and is shocked to discover how high up the corruption goes. Formulaic? Yes, sir. A showcase for Seagal's martial arts stylings and whispery delivery? Guilty as charged. But on the plus side, Seagal has slimmed down a bit, lost the sleazy ponytail, and resisted (or was restrained from indulging) the urge to sing or deliver extended monologues about the environment. The movie's comic relief is supplied by Walker's chubby partner-in-crime T.K. (the ingratiating Anthony Anderson) and TV shock jock Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold), whom Boyd meets in anger management class. The closing credits run alongside footage featuring the duo co-hosting Henry's tacky TV show, and they're so spontaneously funny together you actually leave wishing you'd seen more of them.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/exit-wounds/review/135116#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Producer</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>3.5</review-rating><review><paragraph>After firmly establishing himself as one of the more creative minds in television with HBO's<i>Six Feet Under</i>, Academy Award-winning screenwriter Alan Ball (AMERICAN BEAUTY) returns to the big screen for his directing debut, and he couldn't have picked material better suited to his own dark sensibilities: Egyptian-American writer Alicia Erian's acerbically funny, deeply sad and downright harrowing autobiographical novel of compromised adolescence.</paragraph><paragraph>Marginalized on account of her heritage on the eve of the first Gulf War, and caught between two selfish parents in the wake of an acrimonious divorce, 13-year-old Lebanese-American Jasira Maroun (newcomer Summer Bishil) is coming of age in Syracuse, NY, without knowing her proper place in her family or the world around her. Jasira understands her burgeoning sexuality and the effect she's beginning to have on men even less, and her self-centered, emotionally needy mother, Gail (Maria Bello), is carelessly teaching her that whatever happens, it's her own fault. When Gail learns that her live-in boyfriend (Chris Messina) has shaved the all the hair from her daughter's inner thighs, Gail blames Jasira and decides it's high time she learned how to act around men. Gail packs her up and ships her off to Houston where Jasira's traditional, Beirut-born father, Rifat (Peter Macdissi), as a NASA engineer. Rifat has just moved into a drab, look-alike housing development -- a sign of financial success he reminds Jasira to tell her mother -- but Jasira is miserable. As tension mounts in the Gulf, the kids at school call her "Towelhead" and a lot worse, and Jasira's new home is no real refuge: Rifat is sarcastic, demeaning and physically abusive, giving his daughter a hard slap in the face when she shows up at the breakfast table in a half-shirt and shorts. But Jasira soon notices that what Rifat forbids in his daughter he finds highly alluring in women his own age, like sexy Thena (Lynn Collins), Rifat's coworker and new girlfriend. Jasira spends her afternoons babysitting for Zack (Chase Ellison), the bratty young son of Rifat's neighbors, Eveyln (Carrie Preston) and Travis Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart), a copy shop employee who expects at to be shipped off to the Gulf at any moment. Rifat, who never once lets anyone forget that his beleaguered Beirut was once considered the Paris of the Middle East, considers Travis little more than an ignorant redneck, but Jasira sees him as something else: sexy. And disturbingly, Travis looks at Jasira in the same way.</paragraph><paragraph>With no one around to teach her about her body (Rifat even forbids her to use a tampon when she has her first period) or her sexuality (Jasira becomes a chronic masturbator after she has her first orgasm looking at the nude women in Travis's skin mags), Jasira has no way to judge impropriety, even when it comes to boys her own age, like goodlooking Thomas (Eugene Jones). It's not until Rifat's wise and hugely pregnant neighbor, Melina (Toni Collette), returns from her honeymoon that Jasira has any one looking out for her, and by then it's too late. And that's the lesson this dark but important film has to teach: In a world of double standards and mixed signals, the less we tell our daughters about sex, the more vulnerable they become. Ironic, then, the level of outrage Ball's film admittedly graphic has inspired. Originally screened under the less provocative title NOTHING IS PRIVATE, the film is now being released under Erian's original title. And that's as it should be: The movie, like Erian's novel, doesn't pull a single punch and stands as one of the frankest depictions of teenage sexuality since Michael Cuesta's bold 12 AND HOLDING. Macdissi, who appeared as a bisexual hustler/phone salesman in Ball's 2007 stage production<i>All That I Will Ever Be</i>, is an amazingly mercurial actor: He's able to go from detestable to sympathetic and back again with quicksilver speed. But the movie belongs to the fifth-billed Bishil, a truly gutsy young actress who captures the essence of young female desire in all its adolescent confusion.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/towelhead/review/295284#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

Producer</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>3</review-rating><review><paragraph>Sometimes a story is so beautifully simple that it's impossible to muck it up, and the animated 3-D<i>Bolt</i>is a perfect example. The premise: A cute little dog named Bolt (voice of John Travolta) and his loving tween-girl owner, Penny (voice of Disney It Girl Miley Cyrus), are the stars of a hit action TV show about a small white German shepherd with superpowers. The producers of the show believe the program's success stems from Bolt's realistic "acting," so to that end, they never let the canine star in on the fact that he's on a TV show, hiding all the cameras and crew so that Bolt grows up thinking he really does have heat vision, a super bark, and the ability to stop trucks with his head. One day, thanks to a series of misunderstandings and misfortunes, Bolt accidentally gets mailed to New York City, sending him on an adventure-filled cross-country journey back to Penny in Hollywood. During his trek, Bolt learns the truth about himself, and makes new friends in the form of a streetwise alley cat and an overly enthusiastic hamster.</paragraph><paragraph>The opening of the movie brilliantly establishes the TV show's fictional world -- the one Bolt thinks is real -- with a superb ten-minute action sequence straight out of a family-friendly Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Bolt, with his super-speed, and Penny, atop her tricked-out scooter, evade helicopters, motorcyclists, and a ticking time bomb, all while speeding along a busy California freeway. There is a kinetic pop to the whole scene, especially when the occasional slow-mo shot lets you see exactly how much time is left before the bomb explodes. This opening does such a good job of setting the fun and snappy tone for the rest of the movie (not to mention taking thrillingly full advantage of the 3-D format) that the generic family-movie elements that come later on don't feel so tedious to grown-ups or boring to kids. And as the story unfolds, Bolt's slow acceptance that he doesn't have special powers provides twists on the old finding-your-way-back-home plot, so the movie amuses both those who make up the film's target audience and the parents along for the ride. This winning mix of exciting action, heart-tugging sentiment, and gentle character comedy makes<i>Bolt</i>yet another solid addition to Disney's history of family-friendly fare.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/bolt/review/294809#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Perry  Seibert</i>

The film gets off to a bang-up start with Agent Jay (Will Smith) teaching a rowdy alien super-worm who's terrorizing subway riders to act right or get smacked right, but the first<i>real</i>order of business is retrieving the formidable Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) from retirement. Kay, his memory of countless close encounters of the icky kind wiped clean by the MiB agency's nifty neuralizer, now runs a rinky-dink post office in Truro, MA, with the same ruthless efficiency he brought to masterminding bug hunts. Leaving aside the fact that Jones' deadpan gravitas is required to keep the amiable Smith from turning the entire film into a goofy riff on how cool he is, the narrative justification for his return involves a sexy alien super-bitch named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her search for some extraterrestrial thingamajig. Serleena, whose fingertips sprout masses of writhing tentacles at the slightest provocation, is fully prepared to destroy Earth in pursuit of this otherworldly doohickey, the "Light of Zartha." Since Agent Kay was in charge of the original Light of Zartha case (wittily recapped as an episode of a cheesy, Peter Graves-hosted TV series called "Mysteries in History"), his expertise is sorely needed. Unfortunately, even after he's been de-neuralized, Kay can't remember where it's hidden. Good thing he left himself a series of clever clues that have the reunited partners rushing around Manhattan like campers on a cosmic scavenger hunt, trying desperately to beat Serleena to the prize. There's also a love interest for Jay named Rita (Rosario Dawson), plus expanded roles for the obnoxious worm aliens and Frank the pug (voice of Tim Blaney) &#x2014; cue the inevitable "Who Let the Dogs Out?" gag &#x2014; and a small but memorable bit for Patrick Warburton. Rip Torn and Tony Shalhoub reprise their roles from the first film, while Johnny Knoxville, of MTV's<i>Jackass</i>, plays an alien with two heads and half a brain. Screenwriter Robert Gordon's credits include the surprisingly clever sci-fi spoof GALAXY QUEST, but he couldn't overcome the fundamental problem with this material: You've seen it before. To his eternal credit, Jones gives his considerable all and even coaxes a startling note of poignancy from one scene, while Smith just bops along, lobbing gags and grinning at the special effects.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/men-black-ii/review/135182#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Holiday movies can, however, be really bad (or at least really mediocre, which is arguably worse), so it's not like there's nothing to strive for in the genre. Lucky for<i>Four Christmases</i>, it passes -- not with flying colors, but not by the skin of its teeth either. It's well acted and it's entertaining -- and who can resist a movie where Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau are brothers, and Robert Duvall is their dad?</paragraph><paragraph>It probably helps that the premise is fairly unique. Happy couple Brad and Kate (Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon) have a great relationship, full of enjoyed mutual activities like ballroom dance classes and sexual role play. Like a lot of young people, they're long past admitting that their respective families are a zillion kinds of crazy, so every year the two orchestrate an alibi, drop gifts in the mail, and hightail it out of town for Christmas. Unfortunately, this particular year turns out a little differently when their airline gets grounded by fog on the morning of their departure -- an event that would only minorly change their plans, if it weren't for the local news anchor broadcasting live from the airport who catches Brad and Kate in the camera's crosshairs and effectively announces to their families that they'll be very much stuck in town for the holiday.</paragraph><paragraph>So now, with no excuse to get them out of it, they have to visit all four homes of their collective parents in one day (which is an hour and 22 minutes in audience years). Each household is a different breed of funny/crazy/terrifying, starting with Brad's father, a grumbling old blue-collar retiree played by Robert Duvall. This stop consists of streaking redneck children, dad insisting he can install his own satellite dish, and continued attacks by Brad's amateur UFC brothers (Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw). Next it's off to Kate's mom's house, a WASPish, doily-covered suburban home full of catty passive-aggression and cougary repressed flirtatious outbursts (mostly toward Brad, since all other men in the house have been long since broken). Kate's mom (Mary Steenburgen) has recently discovered religion, which is to say she's dating Pastor Phil, a reverend/local celebrity from the neighborhood Pentecostal rock-concert-style revival church. This creates an extra dose of weirdness for the couple, when she drags them to mass.</paragraph><paragraph>So then Brad and Kate visit the next parent on the list, then the next -- you get the idea. It's a cleverly written movie, and outside the awesomely gross vomit gags and just-painful-enough-looking slapstick, there's always the underlying feeling that what you're seeing is eerily familiar. These are people you've been stuck with at parties or meals, trying desperately to avoid talking about politics, money, or any other disastrously substantive topic; the trashy ones who serve food you don't want to touch, the backbiting ones who talk smack about your marital status, the super normal ones who wait years to throw an awkwardness curveball at you by suddenly getting way, way into religion. It's spot-on "funny because it's true" humor, which may not be a particularly genius page out of the comedy playbook, but after a day of unwrapping presents with people who share your DNA -- and sap your will to live -- it doesn't have to be.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/christmases/review/295990#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila Albertson</i>

Blight</name><role>Producer</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>3</review-rating><review><paragraph>Of all the great historical "what ifs" of the 20th century, "What if President John F. Kennedy had lived to serve out his presidency?" is among the most provocative. Under Kennedy's stewardship, would the United States have sunk deeper into the war in Vietnam? Would he have said no to the massive escalation of U.S. troops and vetoed the devastating air campaign against North Vietnam? Would 58,000 U.S. soldiers and some 2 million Vietnamese gone on to live their lives? Or would JFK have made no difference whatsoever?</paragraph><paragraph>Such thinking isn't mere idle speculation or Monday morning quarterbacking on an epochal scale. It is rather a trend in historiography (albeit a controversial one) known as "counterfactual" or "virtual history": an historical accounting in which the facts as they<i>might</i>have been are examined in order to determine the relative importance of a particular occurrence or individual. Critics like to cite the example of Cleopatra's nose to mock the counterfactual approach, but it does provide a vivid, if reductive, example: Had the Egyptian queen's nose been just the slightest bit longer, Marc Antony wouldn't have been so entranced, Rome wouldn't have fallen and Western history would have been completely different. This interesting but ultimately unsatisfying documentary from the young Japanese-born, U.S.-based filmmaker Koji Matsutani and international-relations expert James G. Blight (who closely advised Errol Morris on THE FOG OF WAR) looks closely at six key moments of Kennedy's thousand-day presidency -- crises over the Bay of Pigs, Laos, and the Berlin wall 1961; Vietnam and Cuba in 1962; and Vietnam once again on the eve of his assassination in 1963 -- all moments when the Cold War could very easily have turned red hot -- in hopes of determining how he would have acted in Vietnam had he lived.</paragraph><paragraph>Throughout each test of Kennedy's nerve and will -- and often in opposition to his closest advisors -- Matsutani and Blight discern Kennedy the peacemaker, and go on to speculate that had he not died in Dallas, Kennedy would once again have said no to war. But rather than go any further into the fascinating what-might-have-beens, the film in its final moments turns to the grim realities of the Johnson presidency. It becomes clear that Matsutani and Blight have simply used Kennedy as an example to prove that an individual as powerful as a U.S. president -- George W. Bush, say -- can make a difference when it comes to matters of war and peace. But it's a foregone conclusion and a basic flaw in the counterfactual argument: By choosing to examine Kennedy in the first place, it already presupposes his crucial importance. The film does, however, assemble an amazing array of recorded conversations and vintage newsreel, and offers up enough press conference footage to make one nostalgic for the days when an uncowed, penetrating press really did serve the public interest, and the president was a smart, inspirational and often very funny figure who could think on his feet and fearlessly take on all comers.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/virtual-jfk-vietnam-kennedy-lived/review/295322#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

In this newest installment in the 007 saga (the 19th or 21st, depending on where you stand on CASINO</paragraph><paragraph>ROYALE and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), Bond (Pierce Brosnan, in fine form) is pitted against a walking dead man named Renard (Robert Carlyle), who feels no pain because of the bullet making its way through his brain. Renard seems to be gunning for beautiful Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), who's inherited an oil empire from her murdered father (an old law school chum of Judi Dench's M) and is constructing a pipeline through a network of unstable former Soviet republics. But what's Elektra<i>really</i>up to, and what's the real story behind her kidnapping several years earlier, an ordeal that left her missing part of an ear and ended when she killed her captors? Bond finds himself entangled with both Elektra and Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), a scientist whose expertise comes in mighty handy when someone needs to explain why it's imperative to disarm that thermonuclear thingamabob sometime in the next three minutes, lest Istanbul become toast. The requisite gadgets include the usual fully loaded car and a pair of X-ray spex that briefly turn Bond into the Immoral Mr. Teas; the action set pieces owe a great deal to previous films, including the ski chase from THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and LIVE AND LET DIE's speed boat hijinks. Purists may be bothered that Bond spends an awful lot of time being rescued from peril by supporting characters, and Richards reaches astonishing heights of ineptitude; Dr. Jones's degree appears to be in aerobics with a minor in Valley Speak. And like all recent Bond movies, the whole thing goes on way too long.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/world/review/133970#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Unfortunately, the happy occasion is disrupted by the arrival of nefarious Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), representative of the rapacious British East India Trading Company, to arrest both bride- and groom-to-be on charges of abetting a scurvy buccaneer by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Weaselly Beckett is a man of the future, where businessmen rule the high seas and inspire more fear in the hearts of the disenfranchised masses than mere pirates ever could, and his five-year plan requires Will to acquire Sparrow's fabled compass on his behalf. What better motivation than to assure Will that should he fail, both he and Elizabeth will hang? Sparrow, meanwhile, has troubles of his own: Having traded his soul to undead pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), captain of the ghostly "Flying Dutchman," in return for 10 years of commanding the pirate vessel "Black Pearl," Sparrow's debt has come due. True to his nature, he's looking for a way out, and a conjure woman (Naomie Harris) advises that he must get his hands on Jones' heart, which is locked in a hidden chest. The rest of Jones is fast becoming one with the briny deep, hands mutated into lobster claws, face dissolving into a mass of squirming tentacles that might, at a misty distance, be taken for a luxurious white beard. And<i>meanwhile</i>, Elizabeth has disguised herself as a beardless lad, the better to go to sea in search of her beloved; disgraced Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport), the fiance Elizabeth jilted for Will, has signed on to the "Black Pearl"; and Will's long-lost dad, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), is languishing aboard the hellish "Dutchman," whose crewmen are slowly mutating into rotting half-men/half-sea-creatures like their captain. But wait, there's more: cannibals, coffins, saucy ladies with a slap for Sparrow, swords, pole-vaulting, graveyard hijinks, cages made of bones, a runaway mill wheel and &#x2014; almost forgot! &#x2014; the kraken, demoted from legendary sea monster to Davy Jones' pet attack squid. You can't beat on DEAD MAN'S CHEST on value-for-money terms, but it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet &#x2014; everything's tasty, the surfeit is sickening.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/pirates-caribbean-dead-mans-chest/review/279940#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Townsend boldly uses a multi-character, multiple point-of-view structure to tell a very big story in a relatively short amount of time. But what the film lacks in artistry it makes up for in commitment, and his film is a reminder of a key event in the anti-globalization movement.</paragraph><paragraph>As representatives of the powerful World Trade Organization converge on Seattle to formulate the global economic policy that will effect millions of people with, as opponents claim, no regard for the environment or the economies and well-being of poor, undeveloped nations, protesters from all over the world flood into the city, prepared to voice their opposition and disrupt the proceedings as best they can. Some, like environmental activist Django Mills (Andre Benjamin) and Jay Elgin (Martin Henderson), whose brother was killed by police while trying to protect old-growth forests, are committed to non-violent action. Others believe it will take more than civil disobedience to catch the WTO's attention. Mayor Jim Tobin (Ray Liotta) is taking every precaution that his city doesn't become like Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and urges cops like Dale (Woody Harrelson) to exercise restraint when dealing with demonstrators, even after they block the entrance to the hotel where the conference is scheduled to take place. By day two, violence has erupted around the city: Masked marauders begin smashing storefront windows and the corporate media makes no distinction between this violent fringe and the peaceful majority, which includes organized labor groups. Relenting to pressure from the Governor (Tzi Ma), Mayor Tobin finally agrees to allow the National Guard into the city, and all hell breaks loose. But not everyone who's come to Seattle to address the WTO has global markets on his or her mind. Abassi (Isaach de Bankole) represents a consortium of struggling post-colonial African nations who hope to convince the WTO to put people before profit; Dr. Maric (Rade Sherbedzija) hopes to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and convince pharmaceutical companies to make their expensive drugs available to the suffering poor. But as chaos erupts on Seattle's streets, their voices will be drowned out and uninvolved bystanders, like Dale's pregnant wife, Ella (Charlize Theron), will find themselves caught in the crossfire.</paragraph><paragraph>From the brief pre-credit sequence outlining the history of the WTO to the epilogue that attempts to cover post-Seattle developments, Townshend's film has a rigid, schematic structure that may be the inevitable result of its effort to present complex and wide-ranging material. Characters are forced to deliver speeches and manifestos rather than speak naturalistic dialogue, but it's still an important consciousness-raising effort and an admirable piece of filmmaking -- Townsend deftly intercuts staged encounters between protesters and police with actual footage of the riots. As Django observes in the smoky aftermath of the riots, people still may not know exactly what the WTO is, but at least they'll now know it's bad.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/battle-seattle/review/294806#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

Though this third installment is not quite as nuts as the second film, it's nevertheless firmly set in the same ridiculous mold. Fans of tongue-in-cheek tough-guy cinema will appreciate the goods on display here -- even if they find it a bit forgettable afterward. This time, producer/screenwriter Luc Besson is back to his old tricks, adding a young female (newcomer Natalya Rudakova) into the equation and letting the film coast on the shaky chemistry between her and Jason Statham. To be sure, though, this is still a succession of films that understands the power of hard kicks, scene-chewing villains, and a sense of fun that continues to be a refreshing change of pace in action cinema's current dour landscape.</paragraph><paragraph>That's not to say that<i>Transporter 3</i>is foolproof -- far from it. As great as it is to have an action star who can hold his own when it comes to a bare-knuckled fist-puncher, Statham's moves (under the keen eye of fight choreographer Corey Yuen) are, more often than not, obscured by frantic editing that doesn't allow the audience to fully appreciate the fisticuffs on display. Equally, one could count on any establishing shot to have the same sort of needless zip-bam-pow editing. As with its<i>Bond</i>action brethren of the same year,<i>Quantum of Solace</i>, it seems that the filmmakers have stooped to copying the frenetic style of the times instead of opting for more traditional cutting techniques that benefited their predecessors so well. Even so, a little Statham charisma goes a long way -- and thankfully there are more than a few over-the-top moments to make this entry noteworthy.</paragraph><paragraph>Surprisingly, much of the flick's running time is dedicated to the one-on-one scenes of the hero and his "package" --the lithe Ukrainian femme Valentina (Rudakova). Moviegoers are made to swallow not only a fair amount of banter between the two, but to forcibly ingest the schmaltzy romantic subplot of it as well (invariably putting a spin on the series' gay subtext, for sure). Especially of concern is Valentina's hard-to-decipher dialogue, which, if one can get over the thick accent, is rife with quirky character work that's downright laughable.</paragraph><paragraph>That said, there's little use tearing<i>Transporter 3</i>down. Questionable style aside, it does what it sets out to do -- entertain. With crazy car stunts and one ludicrous bike chase, along with the firm grasp that it's always best to have the hero fight the biggest guy last, this third installment should tide viewers over until they can get their next Euro-tinged action spectacle. Let's hope next time the reins aren't handed over to a director and editor whose biggest accomplishment before this was working on the Timothy Olyphant mess<i>Hitman</i>.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/transporter-3/review/295991#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Jeremy  Wheeler</i>

Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a lifelong crook who specializes in talking bank clerks out of large sums of</paragraph><paragraph>money. Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is a cocksure, Florida-based federal marshal who adores her dad (Dennis Farina), guns and unsuitable men; her current squeeze is grandstanding FBI agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton, doing an uncredited reprise of his JACKIE BROWN role), who's  both married and</paragraph><paragraph>a dope. Jack and Karen meet when she accidentally interrupts his jailbreak, and she winds up sharing a couple of hours with Jack in the trunk of his partner Buddy's (Ving Rhames) car. During the cramped, sexually fraught trip in the trunk, Jack and Karen reluctantly fall for one another: Perhaps</paragraph><paragraph>it really is all about propinquity, as poor, neglected Zelda Gilroy used to tell Dobie Gillis. Even after she escapes, Karen fantasizes dreamily about Jack; he's doing the same, while he and Buddy plan to rob a smug Detroit financial whiz (Albert Brooks) who keeps millions in uncut diamonds in his</paragraph><paragraph>house and wasn't smart enough not to talk about it when he was doing time for insider trading. Elmore Leonard's huge collection of sharply drawn unsavory characters is perfectly cast, from the leads to a bevy of supporting (but emphatically not lesser) lights, including Steve Zahn as a chatty jail</paragraph><paragraph>house hanger-on; Don Cheadle as psycho boxing buff Snoopy Miller and Nancy Allen as a beleaguered victim of his gang; Luis Guzman as a prison hard-case; Catherine Keener as Foley's flaky ex-wife; and an uncredited Samuel L. Jackson as a prison-bound con whose interests dovetail serendipitously</paragraph><paragraph>with Foley's.

A British singer (Julie Andrews) and an aging homosexual (Robert Preston) are down-and-out nightclub performers in Paris. Hungry and broke, they're desperate for employment until Toddy (Preston) recasts his friend as</paragraph><paragraph>the female impersonator singer-dancer Victor/Victoria--putting the chanteuse in the unusual position of being a woman who pretends to be a man who performs as a woman onstage. She is an immediate hit at a local nightclub, where King (James Garner), a gangster from Chicago traveling with his blowsy</paragraph><paragraph>girlfriend (a Jean Harlowesque Lesley Ann Warren) and his bodyguard, Squash (Alex Karras), sees her perform. King is attracted to Victor/Victoria, but thinks, like everyone else, that she is a transvestite. The burly Squash, meanwhile, watches in amazement as his macho boss apparently loses his</paragraph><paragraph>yen for beautiful women and becomes attracted to his own kind.</paragraph><paragraph>Edwards' film forces audiences to examine their own ideas about gender and sexuality, and that's great. But Andrews, despite looking very Berlin Bowie in her tux, is so safe and sane, she brings no madness of her own to the farce. Everything therefore swirls around a still center--in the film's</paragraph><paragraph>one good number, "Le Jazz Hot", she climbs a staircase like she has weights on her feet. Nor can she summon any of the impersonator's hauteur or joy to her masquerade. Robert Preston is wonderful--he plays a cliche with such malice and relish, he revitalizes it, and Garner is successful kidding</paragraph><paragraph>his own past macho image. A platinumed Warren is also quite good, but Edwards makes her dopey sweetness go sour--he humiliates her, especially in a chorus line number that could make a feminist a raging virago. Will someone please give Warren a role worthy of her undeniable talent? The film's best</paragraph><paragraph>moments are early on: Andrews warbling for disinterested cabaret owners, or the preparation of Victoria to become Victor. After that, this becomes increasingly coarse and overstated. Edwards directs like a grizzly bear whipping up a souffle. The screenplay was based on VIKTOR UND VIKTORIA, a 1933</paragraph><paragraph>German film, first refashioned in 1935 into a star vehicle for the ever-delightful Jessie Mathews, FIRST A GIRL.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/victorvictoria/review/122090#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

Shelly was murdered before she could continue developing as a writer and director, and while this, her last film, is extremely uneven and undermined by an excess of quirk, Keri Russell's performance as a pregnant pie-guru is a charmer with a bracing streak convincingly desperate determination.</paragraph><paragraph>Waitress Jenna (Keri Russell) works at a Joe's Pie Diner, an off-beat, small-town shrine to the baker's craft. Sweet and savory, open-faced and lattice-topped, filled with lemon chiffon or spaghetti, Jenna can make it, and she can make it work. Trained at her late mother's knee, she can transform the most unlikely ingredients into confections as unpredictable and complex as the inner turmoil that inspires them. She's a sweetheart, ready to give mousey fellow waitress Dawn (Shelly) a make-over or serve cranky Old Joe (Andy Griffith) when sassy Becky (Cheryl Hines, channeling Polly "kiss my grits" Holliday from TV's<i>Alice</i>) just can't deal with his complaints. But she's not a doormat: there's a bittersweet finish to Jenna's perky pleasantries. You can even see how she wound up with controlling, pathologically jealous Earl (Jeremy Sisto):  She married young and gave him the benefit of the doubt, a mistake she first repented then took steps to correct. Jenna is secretly saving up money for her escape and scheming to enter upcoming pie bake-off with a hefty cash prize. And then she comes up pregnant. After baking an "I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie," Jenna reluctantly decides to go through with the pregnancy &#x2014; after all, it's no one's fault but her own that she got drunk and slept with her loutish spouse &#x2014; and drowns her ever-expanding sorrows in a torrid affair with the new OB/GYN in town (Nathan Fillian).</paragraph><paragraph>There no way around it: Russell's performance is spunky and just about irresistible, no matter how much you hate spunk. It's hard to imagine WAITRESS working without her: Hines and Shelly are in there slinging one-note performances &#x2014; cute, but 100% depth free &#x2014; and Russell is quietly making Jenna into a richly textured character: When she looks at her belly and mutters, "dumb baby!" or whips up a Pregnant Miserable Self-Pitying Loser Pie, the laugh comes with a bitter side of rue.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/waitress/review/287704#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

When a less than reverent presidential biopic comes out while said commander in chief is still in office, the context provided by the timing is a lot less obvious -- but make no mistake, it's still there. Making a distinctly historical film about a history that's still happening places<i>W.</i>simply and unmistakably in its own artistic context: postmodernism. After all, it's hard to get more self-referential than a movie that lets modern times reflect upon themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>However, this isn't totally apparent for the first 20 minutes of<i>W.</i>, and it's hard to say if that's Oliver Stone's fault or ours. Watching the movie, it takes a little time to let go of all those pesky preexisting expectations, and adjust to what at first seems a tad lowbrow and simplistic. But by the same token, walking into<i>W.</i>expecting<i>Natural Born Killers-esque</i>manic black satire, or<i>JFK-esque</i>subtle, multifaceted subtext isn't going to help your viewing experience. In<i>W.</i>, the story can't possibly be told in complex terms because the perspective is first person, and the person in question just doesn't have those kinds of perceptive tools.<i>This</i>is how Stone gets subtle: the hero doesn't narrate the story with a Texas-drawled "Dear Diary" voice-over, yet the movie still effectively provides Dubya's experiences from his own perspective. It's obvious enough from the zillion super close-ups on his bewilderedly determined expression (and the fact that there's a dream sequence), but most of the time, the vantage point manifests itself in the way the events unfold -- and it works brilliantly once you get the hang of it.</paragraph><paragraph>After the period of adjustment is over, it makes perfect sense for the story to be so literal and straightforward -- or at least appear so on the surface. It alternates between two timelines: one that follows Dubya from college through the 2000 election, and one that follows him from 9/11 through the full-on nosedive of the Iraq War. There are no intricately woven metaphors, and no mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma, just a direct narrative about a fairly unspecial guy with some daddy issues, who endeavors -- but usually fails -- to deserve the opportunities that family string-pulling allows him. When there's symbolism, it's painted in strokes broad enough to fit on an IMAX screen -- he bends over to pray in the War Room, for instance, and it cuts to an upward shot where a huge, hard-edged, blindingly bright ring-shaped lighting fixture encircles his head.</paragraph><paragraph>Dubya's failures and shortcomings are readily apparent enough -- even to people who haven't seen the movie -- so Stone doesn't have to deviate from the main character's perspective for us to understand the disaster left in Dubya's wake. He trusts that we don't need the filmmaker to vilify or even mock Dubya from the third person, and despite the aforementioned halo (which, of course, is a depiction advocated by the character, not the filmmaker) he also doesn't paint devil horns on the members of the administration like Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) and Condoleezza Rice (Thandie Newton). They bear their share of guilt as exploiters, yes men, and even blinded ideologues, but Stone never resorts to portraying them as the evil power-mongers who used this poor simpleton for their own nefarious ends. Well, maybe Cheney.</paragraph><paragraph>If anything, the supporting cast members are just a hair over the line between character and caricature -- a choice that ends up being the cherry on top of that first-person narrative. It provides inescapable novelty (who doesn't like to see a spot-on Colin Powell impression?), but it also illustrates Dubya's blunted and simplified image of everything around him, the way he sees every important figure and idea in slightly cartoonish opaqueness. Certainly, this conceptual hub of the movie depends on star Josh Brolin, whose ability to overcome his own rugged, chiseled jaw and portray Dub's weakness so believably in this regard is pretty mind-blowing (and equally novel). In the end, it's clear that this basic weakness of both mind and confidence was at the root of all the president's epic failures, and while the character of Dubya himself doesn't appear totally self-aware about it, the audience has no trouble figuring it out -- a sure sign of the film's success.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/w/review/295671#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Cammila  Albertson</i>

David Aames (Cruise) is on top of the world: He's rich, handsome and runs his late father's trendy magazine empire with the hedonistic disdain of a prince. With armies of sour-faced worker ants on staff to do the "work," David devotes himself to the perks, like the glittering girls who flutter seductively around him. At David's 33rd birthday party, his less-handsome, considerably less-wealthy best friend Brian (Jason Lee) shows up with a personable beauty on his arm. Her name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz, who also starred in the original film), Brian says; they met that afternoon in a library, and he thinks she just might be the<i>one</i>. Brian's confidence doesn't stop David from turning on the high-voltage charm, or from spending the night at Sofia's charmingly rundown apartment. All they do is talk, mind you, but David's fundamental caddishness is firmly established. Brian isn't the only partygoer miffed by David's shameless flirting. The following morning, David finds leggy beauty Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), with whom he's been enjoying a meaningless fling, waiting at the curb. The fling, it turns out, was meaningless to David but meant rather more to Julie. She entices David into her car, then, bitterly decrying his careless manhandling of her heart, drives headlong off a bridge. When David eventually emerges from his accident-induced coma, he learns that Julie is dead and he's been horribly disfigured. David tells this tale to a court-appointed psychiatrist (Kurt Russell) from behind an eerie, flesh-colored mask; David has been arrested for murdering someone &#x97; maybe Julie, maybe Sofia... Things all get mixed up in the telling. Is David's face really scarred, or has it been repaired by a miraculous new form of plastic surgery? And what of David's dream about finding himself in a thoroughly deserted Times Square? Are the empty streets just a symbol of loneliness, or are there more sinister implications? Writer-director Cameron Crowe preserves the original film's plot twists and turns, but his version lumbers when it should be whipping along, daring you to keep up. The wall-to-wall pop music soundtrack eventually becomes oppressive, and Cruise's oily smile doesn't really constitute a characterization &#x97; Tilda Swinton blows him out of the water in her all-too-few minutes of 11th-hour screen time.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/vanilla-sky/review/135518#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

It's both the shortest 3 1/2 hours you'll ever spend at the movies and spectacle of such magnitude that it's hard to imagine feeling you didn't get your time and money's worth.</paragraph><paragraph>It begins with eerie underwater images of the Titanic's remains, resting beneath the Atlantic since its close encounter with an iceberg in 1912. The footage comes courtesy of a salvage expedition led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), whose hidden purpose is to recover a fabulous blue diamond. The gem was bought by caddish roue Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) for his fiancee Rose (Kate Winslet), and apparently lost -- with the girl -- in the wreck. Imagine Lovett's surprise when he's contacted by a 101-year-old woman (Gloria Stuart) who claims to be the missing Rose and offers to tell all about what happened that cold, dreadful night. Everybody knows the plot in its broad outlines: The Titanic -- marvel of modern engineering and floating monument to hubris -- will sink, and more than half its passengers will die ("Not the better half," says the hissably shallow Cal) because there</paragraph><paragraph>aren't enough lifeboats for them.</paragraph><paragraph>The drama is in the details, and Cameron pays lip service to the human tragedy: women and children saved while their men stay behind to die; first-class passengers ushered into lifeboats while steerage passengers are held below; the band playing "Nearer My God to Thee" as the icy water rises; individual acts of valor and cowardice that have been told and retold in books, movies and even songs. Cameron concocts a fictional romance between poor little rich girl Rose and penniless free-spirit Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), the better to highlight the brutal class struggle and give tragedy a dewy young face. But his heart is in the spectacle: The drama is cliched, if competently effective, but Cameron's dissolves from the Titanic's rusted hulk to her brand spanking new decks are breathtaking, even poetic. And the sight of the great ship foundering on the black, black sea, its massive stern rising up from the water like a whale's tale, is simply unforgettable. You can cavil that it doesn't look real -- who in this digital age believes seeing is believing? -- but think about it: It probably didn't look real that night 85 years ago, either.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/titanic/review/132077#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

He's beautiful (Robert Pattinson is on the path to being the most sought-after man-child since<i>Romeo + Juliet</i>-era Leonardo DiCaprio), he can read minds, and virtually all of his female classmates alternate between lovesickness and trepidation (the Cullens are all a little unsettling in their beauty). In any case, he isn't interested. Enter Bella Swan, Teenage Girl. She's the new kid in a small, perpetually overcast Washington town called Forks. Her first days of school aren't exactly traumatizing; she makes friends easily and attracts her fair share of Forks boys, but she still doesn't feel she fits in and misses her home in Arizona. Everything changes after she locks eyes with Edward Cullen, who doesn't know if he should kill Bella (he admits the scent of her blood is like his "brand of heroin") or allow himself to fall in love with her. This is where The Teen Girl Effect comes into play.<i>Twilight</i>is grade-A film crack. The dialogue leaves much to be desired and the special effects are like something out of an old episode of<i>The Outer Limits</i>. Edward's inner struggle to resist the allure of Bella's blood, and Bella's mixed feelings and hurt regarding Edward's erratic behavior plays like a rushed attempt at paving the way to their first kiss.</paragraph><paragraph>It's not long before Edward and Bella declare their "unconditional, irrevocable" love for one another despite the inherent danger of a love affair between predator and prey (referred to as "the lion falling in love with the lamb" in both the book and film). Bella is willing to give up everything for a boy she hardly knows because she's convinced Edward is her true love, and to be separated from him would be unbearable. It's not a shining moment in terms of social progress for women -- however, if you are a teenage girl, or an adult who secretly keeps a warm place in your heart for your inner-teen to write bad poetry and long for the day her emo Prince Charming will realize just how special and different she really is, this movie delivers the goods.<i>Twilight</i>is almost a spot-on adaptation of the book, down to the mushroom ravioli Bella orders on her first sort-of date with Edward. Similar shout-outs to book fans occur throughout the course of the film; this, along with the casting (though he's not the hero of the story, Billy Burke makes a great protective father), captures the essence of the novel quite accurately.</paragraph><paragraph>In terms of bringing the book to life,<i>Twilight</i>is a complete success, so much so that most of the film's flaws work within the context of the story. Kristen Stewart is sometimes awkward and self-conscious in her delivery, but Bella is an awkward, self-conscious character. Robert Pattinson appears to have taken a hint from<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>'s Angel and attended Broody Vampires Who Hate Their Predatory Nature 101, but that's the nature of Edward Cullen. Director Catherine Hardwicke's influence shows in the rival vampire clan (James [Cam Gigandet]), Laurent [Edi Gathegi], and Victoria [Rachelle Lefevre]), who offer a subtly different menace than the Cullens, in that where the Cullens are mostly a benign kind of scary, these vamps love the thrill of the hunt, and it shows. Unlike Edward's family, this clan doesn't believe in leading a "vegetarian" (code for drinking animal blood as opposed to human) lifestyle. These are not self-loathing vampires, and when they catch Bella's scent during a family baseball game, James assumes Bella is the post-game meal. The pacing gets a little odd after this -- Bella's leaving her father, she's in a car, she's on a plane, in a hotel room, outside the hotel, and inside the ballet studio where the epic vampire battle is to take place. Gigandet is appropriately creepy as a vampire obsessed with tracking and killing his prey, though once again the battle seems like an inconvenient obstacle preventing Bella and Edward from staring dreamily at one another. It's a forgivable sin, though -- after all, the<i>Twilight</i>demographic (and their unashamed adult fans) is prone to skipping to the kissing parts anyway.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/twilight/review/295116#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Tracie  Cooper</i>

Habitual romance reader Andrea McBride Hatfield (Tracy Nelson) catches her husband, Troy (Darren Gray Ward), in flagrante delicto and attacks him; she winds up in a mental hospital. Even after she's declared cured, Andrea continues to confuse the make-believe world of novellas like "The Passion of Mandy" with reality. Like the fictional Mandy, a governess who marries up, Andrea sets out to wed a rich, handsome doctor. While working as a receptionist job at an employment agency, she's privy to potential nanny positions and widower Dr. James Lewis (Bruce Boxleitner) that she's an experienced domestic caregiver (having conveniently eliminated her prime competitor with a toppled bookcase).  Once installed in Lewis's household, Andrea proves indispensable. She wins over the doctor's bratty son and bonds with his teenaged daughter Fawn, (Dana Barron), who resents her father's attachment to co-worker Dr. Julia Bruning (Susan Blakely). With her eyes on the marital prize, Andrea makes sure Bruning drowns in her pool. Later, when Lewis's boss threatens to upset the apple cart, Andrea ambushes him and makes the attack look like a mugging. But she makes the mistake of tipping her hand to Fawn, who doesn't regard Andrea as stepmother material, and isn't prepared for the return of her possessive ex-husband, who's been pressuring her mom, Mrs. McBride (Katherine Helmond), about Andrea's whereabouts. Now there are<i>three</i>obstacles on the path to Nanny's happy ending: jealous Troy, blackmailing Mrs. McBride and suspicious Fawn. A charismatic psychopath goes a long way to making a horror movie enjoyable, and  the personable Nelson is the derivative but efficient picture's greatest asset.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/perfect-nanny/review/136583#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Robert Pardi</i>

On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old boy in a Halloween mask stabs his sister to death after she makes love to her boyfriend. He's institutionalized--until, exactly 15 years later, he escapes and returns to his small Illinois hometown once more to wreak</paragraph><paragraph>Halloween havoc. His psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) proclaims "The Evil is loose!" and is in hot pursuit with the authorities. Meanwhile Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) seems to be the only girl in town without a date for Halloween. All her high school friends seem to have hot dates</paragraph><paragraph>scheduled but bright, bookish Laurie must settle for a quiet evening of babysitting, fending off trick-or-treaters, and watching old science fiction movies on television. Just another boring evening? Hardly.</paragraph><paragraph>There's nary a drop of blood on screen in this rollicking funhouse of a movie but there is enough sheer cinematic ingenuity on display to coax screams out of the most jaded gorehound. Cheap thrills--often accompanied by a joybuzzer noise on the soundtrack--lurk on the periphery of nearly every</paragraph><paragraph>frame and film history allusions abound. Fans the moving camera also have reason to cheer as the Steadicam prowls the suburban streets unexpectedly turning into ominous point-of-view shots accompanied by creepy piano music (composed by the resourceful Carpenter). The performances are also far</paragraph><paragraph>better than average for this kind of fare. Pleasance is a hoot as he gnaws on the scenery and the pleasingly equine beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis--at the beginning of the fondly remembered Queen of the B's stage of her career--enhances her sensitive performance.</paragraph><paragraph>HALLOWEEN was the surprise hit of the 1978 Chicago Film Festival. Some over-enthusiastic critics even compared it with Hitchcock's classic PSYCHO (which starred Curtis's mother, Janet Leigh) but such comparisons are silly and groundless; HALLOWEEN is just a superbly made unpretentious thriller</paragraph><paragraph>whereas one can make higher claims for PSYCHO. Furthermore Carpenter's clean, economical style owes a much greater debt to another master craftsman--Howard Hawks.

Near-peak Judy Garland under the stylish direction of her future husband, Vincente Minnelli, in this wonderful period musical. It opens in 1903 in St. Louis, where Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames), a well-to-do businessman, lives with his</paragraph><paragraph>wife (Mary Astor), daughters (Garland, Lucille Bremer, Joan Carroll, and Margaret O'Brien), son (Hank Daniels), capricious Grandpa (Harry Davenport), and maid (Marjorie Main). Daughter Rose (Bremer) is courted by one beau at home and corresponds with another away at college, while Esther (Garland)</paragraph><paragraph>becomes engaged to the new boy next door. Little sisters Agnes (Joan Carroll) and Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) represent the timeless mischief of childhood. Trouble arises when Alonzo is promoted and ordered to New York, a move no one in the family wants to make.</paragraph><paragraph>This is a peerless portrayal of America at the turn of the century and one family's struggles to deal with progress, symbolized by the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis (beautifully re-created for the film). Minnelli proves his eye for detail and captures the era and its values in richly colored,</paragraph><paragraph>gentle images, displaying a startling balance of emotions from scene to scene, song to song. Among the songs included in this triumph of Americana are "The Boy Next Door," "Meet Me in St. Louis," the marvelous production number "The Trolley Song," and Garland's evergreen "Have Yourself a Merry</paragraph><paragraph>Little Christmas". An almost unbeatable musical. Note Garland's beauty in this film: a tribute to the overhaul given her by Dottie Pondell, whose services Garland had snatched from under the noses of every major star in Hollywood, upon the death of Carole Lombard.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/meet-st-louis/review/105912#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

Producer</role></credit></credit-list><review-rating>2.5</review-rating><review><paragraph>On paper, Kevin Smith's<i>Zack &amp; Miri Make a Porno</i>would appear to be a perfect project for his particular comedic style -- a blend of R-rated talk and a G-rated mushiness. The premise is a perfect high-concept pitch -- platonic BFFs Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are struggling twentysomethings who decide to make the titular adult film after their financial situation turns dire, and they meet a surprise guest at their high school reunion (a scene-stealing Justin Long) with an unusual career history. The catch, of course, is that they have no idea how doin' it will alter their close friendship.</paragraph><paragraph>The setup allows Smith to revel in tons of gleefully vulgar jokes, which he spreads among every member of the cast. Rogen brings his winning slacker charm to Zack, keeping his vulnerabilities poorly hidden behind a barrage of profanity. Banks matches him well; her desperation, especially when she throws herself at an old crush (a surprisingly sweet Brandon Routh), explains why she would remain devoted to her and Zack's friendship. And since both these young actors graduated from the Judd Apatow School of Raunchy Sentiment, they know how to balance the gross-out with the heartfelt. Kevin Smith's dialogue falls short of matching the dizzying highs hit by Apatow and Co., but his decision to cast his talented new collaborators was a savvy move. These progenies of modern comedy all know how to get the maximum impact out of what's on the page, but sadly, Smith himself falls back on the familiar View Askew faces like Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson -- both of whom continually dissipate the movie's freshness, as neither is talented enough to bring anything new to the table. It's not that they're bad, they're just woefully uninspired. Smith's refusal to find new creative partnerships compromises not only the performances, but the look of the film as well. Cinematographer Dave Klein ("DP Dave" to those who enjoy Smith's always entertaining commentaries) recycles the same static setups from<i>Clerks</i>, mimicking the 15-year-old waking-up montage almost shot for shot during the opening credits.</paragraph><paragraph><i>Chasing Amy</i>may well have been the high point of Smith's career, revealing his talent for examining the sometimes uncomfortable collision between friendship and romantic love, but<i>Zack &amp; Miri</i>still finds a fresh approach to this topic, most notably by avoiding the typical love triangle. The big scene where the two leads finally get it on in front of the camera turns out to be a highlight of Smith's career. Close up, we see the touching, intimate moment the two are sharing, while further back, we see how hilariously non-pornographic it looks to everybody else on set. He wrings laughs out of the hazy border shared by love and sex without being prudish or sappy, and it's an achievement that showcases the best of what this film offers. Unfortunately, the third act never strays from the standard structure of every romantic comedy - misunderstanding, then breakup, then will-they-or-won't-they-reunite tension. There are no surprises, and while anybody still with the film won't abandon it at this point, there is the nagging sense you're watching unrealized potential -- a problem common to all of Smith's films since<i>Dogma</i>. In a sense, this makes<i>Zack &amp; Miri</i>stand out as Kevin Smith's most thoroughly representative film -- both for better and for worse.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/zack-miri-make-porno/review/295281#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Perry  Seibert</i></paragraph></review></movie><movie tvgid="26208"><name>Star Trek Iv: The Voyage Home</name><rank>35</rank><year>1986</year><rating>PG</rating><country>U.S.</country><running-time>119</running-time><format>Color</format><genres><genre>Fantasy</genre><genre>Science Fiction</genre></genres><production-companies><production-company>Paramount</production-company></production-companies><released-by>Paramount</released-by><user-rating><rating>4.5</rating><support>11</support></user-rating><script>based on a story by Leonard Nimoy, Harve Bennett, and the TV series created by Gene Roddenberry</script><actor-list><actor><name>Nichelle Nichols</name><role>Comdr.

This sweet and startlingly visionary feature brings Pixar full circle: Its hero is a small, heartbreakingly lovelorn android who adores<i>Hello, Dolly!</i>and a high-tech space probe named EVA, and it's company's greatest achievement to date.</paragraph><paragraph>The late, great planet Earth, circa 2800 AD: Seven hundred years have passed since earthlings abandoned their hopelessly polluted, sun-scorched landfill of a planet and boarded the Axiom, an enormous ark/starship owned and operated by the ubiquitous, Wal-Mart-styled retail giant Buy N Large. According to Shelby Forthright (Fred Willard), BnL's unctuous, Bush-ism-spouting CEO, the move was meant to be temporary: While Earth's citizens floated through space in cruise-line comfort, an army of solar-powered, trash-compacting androids known as WALL-Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifters -- Earth Class) would swarm the planet, collecting and compressing all the garbage into neat little piles, hopefully restore Earth to a state capable of sustaining life. "Operation Clean-Up" was meant to take five years, but seven centuries later earthlings are still drifting through space aboard the Axiom, and they've devolved into little more than technology dependent blobs of fat with little intelligence, muscle tissue or bone mass, and no memory of the bright blue marble they once called home. Meanwhile on Earth -- where the only sign of life among the ruined buildings and towering ziggurats of cubed garbage is the proverbially indestructible cockroach -- only one WALL-E (voice of Ben Burtt) seems to be still functioning. Each day, despite the existential fruitlessness of it all, WALL-E goes about his appointed rounds, collecting and compacting trash into small cubes and keeping random objects that strike his robotic fancy: a Rubik's cube, a light bulb, a Zippo lighter and a single slim, green sprout of plant life found safely hidden inside an abandoned refrigerator. Once his day is done, WALL-E and cockroach friend return to the derelict transport vehicle they call home to enjoy WALL-E's most prized possession: a old VHS cassette of the 1969 movie HELLO, DOLLY. Watching the screen lovers tentatively hold hands, fingers entwined, WALL-E longs for companionship. He gets more than he bargained for when a huge exploratory craft deposits a fetchingly sleek, Mac-inspired piece of glossy white high-tech robotics designed to test the Earth for life sustainability. Here name is EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), and for lonely WALL-E, it's love at first sight.</paragraph><paragraph>The film's second half -- which takes place almost entirely aboard the Axiom -- is a hilarious comment on the rapid devolution of human civilization a la Mike Judge's IDIOCRACY: In our fat and lazy technology-enslaved future, we won't even need to chew for ourselves, thanks to Big Gulp-sized sippy cups. The film is bright, fast-paced fun in the Pixar tradition with an obvious environmental message, but it's the first half of WALL-E that's the real achievement. Aside from a few blips and beeps, there's nary a word spoken, and the whole thing unfolds like a deeply poignant, Chaplin-esque pantomime set amid the grease and grime of frighteningly realized dead world. It can hardly be called a children's film, but a masterpiece of feature-film animation for all ages.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/wall-e/review/292190#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

Stark's sound-bite patriotism lies over a genuine, if not deeply considered, belief that Stark munitions are making the world safe for his fellow Americans, a position he's compelled to rethink after being wounded and taken hostage by Afghan terrorists during a mega-missile demo/photo op. Held in a mountain camp bristling with Stark products and tethered to a primitive device buried in his chest -- the only thing standing between his heart and stealthy shards of shrapnel lurking in his flesh &#x2013; Stark is ordered to build his captors their very own super WMD. He instead forges an iron robo-suit and escapes; his first act back in the US is to make the startling announcement that Stark Industries is out of the weapons business until further notice. While Stark devotes himself to constructing an improved version of the suit that saved his life, rumors that he's suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome threaten to destabilize Stark Industries. The three people closest to him &#x2013; loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow); friend and military liaison James "Rhodey" Rhodes (Terrence Howard); and longtime right-hand Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) &#x2013; react in very different ways, both before and after they discover exactly what he's been working on and what he plans to do with it.</paragraph><paragraph>Downey, 42, gets under the skin of a character whose devil-may-care arrogance, born of lifelong privilege, is viciously ripped away, an experience that makes a better man of him, but not a<i>different</i>one. He's still cocky, self-centered and superficially imperious, but he knows he's not untouchable, which  has as much to do with being obliged to ask Pepper to plunge her hand into the perpetually open hole in his chest and adjust the device keeping him alive as it does his newly awakened conscience. His performance grounds the film's fantastic trappings -- from the sleek Iron Man armor to Pepper's ability to sprint in strappy, sky-high heels &#x2013; in emotional reality.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/iron-man/review/292484#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Successful landscaper Gus Matthews (Rob Schneider) has a soft spot in his heart for geeks, and has not only taken pathetic paper-boy Clark (NAPOLEON DYNAMITE star Jon Heder) under his protective wing, but he spontaneously comes to the rescue of born-victim Nelson (Max Prado) when he sees the pathetic little doofus being picked on by adolescent baseball jocks. Gus is also a stunningly talented athlete with a gorgeous blonde wife (Molly Sims) who wants nothing more than to wrestle him into bed, albeit because she's desperate to get pregnant. But still &#x2014; not bad for a guy who looks like the second-rate comedian who's always lurking on the sidelines of his pal Adam Sandler's movies... oh, wait, he<i>is</i>that guy, and the fact that Schneider has to be the least convincing athletic powerhouse on earth isn't the joke. The joke is that Nelson's dad turns out to be dweeb-turned-multizillionaire Mel Schmegmer (Jon Lovitz), who drives K.I.T.T. from<i>Knight Rider</i>(his other car is the Batmobile) and offers to underwrite a baseball team built around Gus, Clark and Clark's friend Richie the video-store geek (David Spade) if they'll agree to play against every Little League team in town so dorks will have someone to root for. Between Gus' all-star skills and a little coaching from Mel's old band-camp pal Reggie Jackson, the Benchwarmers are soon wiping the ground with two generations of smug, self-esteem-annihilating jackasses &#x2014; the ones who pantsed them in high school<i>and</i>their chip-off-the-old-block kids. They're stars of mega-downloaded video podcasts and an inspiration to spazzes everywhere, but Gus has a secret past that just might destroy everything they've worked for. Produced by &#x2014; surprise! &#x2014; Adam Sandler and directed by protege Dennis Dugan, this formulaic mess of sports-movie cliches and self-esteem claptrap contains a couple of funny bits, like Jackson teaching fast reflexes through doorbell-ringing pranks, but you have to slog through a lot of done-to-death bodily function jokes to get to them.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/benchwarmers/review/279534#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland  McDonagh</i>

The producers at Lionsgate want to play a game with you. For the last four years, you've been subjected to torturous displays of horrific morality lessons, in hopes that you'd come back for more blood-soaked exploits of the serial killer Jigsaw. With each entry, the stakes have become higher and the plots more complex. So far you've seen dozens of devices of death, each containing its own virtuous lecture on the evils of humanity. There've been silly sequels (<i>Saw II</i>), overly serious ones (<i>Pt. III</i>), as well as the ludicrous follow-up that led to this movie,<i>Saw V</i>. You now have a choice: you can continue this maddening journey or put this well-worn franchise out of its misery. Let it not be said that you weren't warned, for on the road ahead lies the biggest rip-off of them all -- a slapdash affair of dramatic drivel that even the most diehard fan will find lacking. Whether or not the bus had already hit the wall on the series long ago, there's little doubt that it's been left thoroughly in flames after this. The choice is yours. Choose wisely.</paragraph><paragraph>When last we saw Jigsaw (played here once again by Tobin Bell), he was lying dead in a makeshift hospital gurney, the product of a buzz saw to the throat (back in<i>Pt. III</i>). Thanks to the wonderful world of flashbacks, he lived on in the fourth film and does so here again; though don't expect too many revelations about his life or his work from this outing. As we learned at the end of<i>IV</i>, Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) -- the detective at the heart of the investigation since<i>Part III</i>-- had been secretly in league with Jigsaw the whole time. Actually, one isn't sure just when he actually started up with the cancerous killer with serious ethics on his brain, though<i>Part V</i>attempts to tell that story -- even if the time frame completely confuses the viewer at every turn. The plot weaves in and out of all of the sequels, with occasional flashbacks to vaguely remind you of how they all tie together. One thing about the<i>Saw</i>series is that you never know exactly when and where things are taking place in regard to what's come before. Usually the film ends with a spinning camera and a character yelling up at the sky, piecing together the movie for you -- except this time, the twist is the equivalent of the<i>Titanic</i>sinking. Of course, there are a few other characters in the flick (the most notable face being<i>Dexter</i>'s Julie Benz), but they really make no difference to the plot and serve only to eat up a few juicy kills.</paragraph><paragraph>And speaking of gore -- where is it? Sure, there's a quick decapitation, some fingers being sliced up, and a guillotined torso, but compared to its precursors,<i>Saw V</i>doesn't come close. And really, that's what the audience is there for. Say all you want about them appreciating the plot twists, but in the end, they're there for the nasty, cringe-worthy stuff. It's as if the writers (<i>Feast</i>'s Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton) were so preoccupied with threading the story's needle that they forgot what kind of movie they were writing. Say what you will about the franchise -- good or bad -- but if the previous filmmakers got anything right, it's that they delivered the goods to their audience. So does<i>Part V</i>cut it? Absolutely not. It's cheap, sloppy, and too jumbled up to know what it should be. With hanging plot threads all over, and a sense that the series really has collapsed in on itself, one has to wonder how Lionsgate could come back with a new entry that continues to successfully question all that came before. What will they do next? Probably rip more people off. It's worked for them so far.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/saw-v/review/295693#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Jeremy  Wheeler</i>

THE GODFATHER changed forever the popular perception of organized crime, implying strong parallels between the workings of the Mafia and those of any other</paragraph><paragraph>profit-making corporation, and imparting operatic gravity to its liberal doses of violence.</paragraph><paragraph>The film opens with the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) daughter Connie (Talia Shire) to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), a small-time bookie. Present at the ceremony is Brando's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a much-decorated Marine captain who has just returned from WWII.</paragraph><paragraph>College-educated, sensitive and perceptive, Michael is unlike almost all the other guests except Kay (Diane Keaton), his WASP sweetheart. Pacino points out gangster luminaries to Kay as a small boy might heroes in a baseball park.</paragraph><paragraph>Problems for the Corleone family arise with the appearance of Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), a maverick gangster who has the backing of a rival Mafia family. In a meeting with the Corleones, Sollozzo informs the family that he intends to establish wide-scale heroin sales in NYC, but requires the</paragraph><paragraph>permission of Don Vito to do so. Corleone, an old-school Mafia don, sends Sollozzo packing, saying that he is disgusted by the thought of narcotics and is content with his gambling, prostitution and protection rackets. (In fact, he is reluctant to jeopardize his political contacts by venturing</paragraph><paragraph>into this controversial new terrain.) The refusal leads to a gang war in which the Godfather is wounded, but not killed, in an assassination attempt.</paragraph><paragraph>Sonny (James Caan) temporarily takes over control of the family from the injured don, as Michael opts to kill Sollozzo and a corrupt police captain in revenge for the attack on Vito. After Michael goes into hiding in Sicily, the volatile Sonny beats up Carlo for having assaulted Connie and is then</paragraph><paragraph>killed in an ambush that Carlo helped set up.</paragraph><paragraph>While in hiding, Michael takes a young Sicilian wife, only to lose her in a botched assassination attempt that was aimed at him by a rival family. Newly hardened, he returns to America to take control of the family from Don Vito who, now recuperated from his injuries, is retiring.</paragraph><paragraph>Great movies aren't usually planned as such; they happen through an unusual confluence of talents and qualities. THE GODFATHER is no exception. Coppola had set out simply to redeem a faltering career when he started to shoot the popular Mario Puzo mafia novel. His talent brought him luck. First he</paragraph><paragraph>collected an extraordinary number of the great actors who made American filmmaking interesting during the 70s and 80s: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall. Then he spiced the mixture with some accomplished character actors: John Marley, Al Lettieri, Sterling Hayden,</paragraph><paragraph>and Coppola's sister, Talia Shire. Coppola also had the eminent good sense--or good luck--to get Nino Rota to write his last great score. He got a finely crafted script from author Puzo, and then worked obsessively to push all involved to the limits of their abilities, and sometimes beyond.</paragraph><paragraph>Puzo's novel (which also redeemed a faltering career) provided not one, but several mythic elements that Coppola was canny enough to reinforce in the film. THE GODFATHER is a generational saga; it's also an action film; but above all, it catches the imagination of audiences because it suggests</paragraph><paragraph>that the career of a gangster is not so very different from the career of a businessman or a politician. This had important resonance for the generation of the early 70s.</paragraph><paragraph>The film is dark--Coppola had cinematographer Gordon Willis deliberately underlight each scene; the mood is dark; and the climax, in which Michael indulges in an orgy of blood vengeance, would simply be horrific, were it not for the ironic melodies of the Rota score, which underline the humane</paragraph><paragraph>sensibilities of the storyteller and keep us at an appropriate distance. And this points to Coppola's greatest achievement with THE GODFATHER; he simultaneously presents us with two views of the Corleone family. We see it from within, sympathizing with the motives and dilemmas of these very real,</paragraph><paragraph>attractive and charismatic individuals; and we see it from without, in a state of suspended disgust at a moral code that knows only greed and blood.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/godfather/review/124688#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>

But Ledger's mesmerizingly damaged agent provocateur is the film's dark heart, a presence so malevolently unpredictable that it remains palpable even when he's not on screen.</paragraph><paragraph>Millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) continues to live his double life as the crusading Batman, but at an ever-escalating personal cost: He's displaced and all but alone. Wayne Manor has been burned to the ground, forcing him into an anonymous high-rise apartment, and childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, taking over from the vapid Katie Holmes) has taken up with crusading district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) who's conducting<i>his</i>war on crime, by the book and in the bright light of day. Faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Wayne Industries' factotum Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) continue to support Bruce's lonely battle against criminals, but Gotham City is still overrun with warring gangs. Public opinion regarding the dark angel is polarized -- grassroots champion of the average citizen or dangerous vigilante? &#x2013; and the headline-grabbing exploits of a pack of untrained, hot-headed imitators who've sprung up in the Batman's shadow only muddy the waters further. Succumbing to the unrelenting pressure, Batman and longtime ally Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman) agree to work with Dent, an arrangement that brings impressive short-term results but sets the stage for an anarchic reign of terror orchestrated by the wild card in the underworld deck: The Joker (Ledger). Having made himself<i>persona non grata</i>among thieves by robbing the banks that launder and safeguard their ill-gotten gains, the Joker then proposes that they all work together to take back the night.</paragraph><paragraph>Written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan (David S. Goyer gets co-story credit), the film juggles multiple intertwined narratives &#x2013; Batman's dark night of the soul, the Joker's machinations, the rise and fall of Dent, the criminal super-alliance &#x2013; without feeling bloated or unfocused; its 142 minutes fly by. Nolan stages some stunning action sequences &#x2013; the opening heist is worthy of Michael Mann &#x2013; and maintains a convincing atmosphere of apocalyptic paranoia; Gotham City is under siege, people are genuinely frightened and life-or-death situations can go either way. But most importantly, he gives his top-notch cast plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. That Ledger stands out in such a powerhouse ensemble is a tribute to his radically unhinged interpretation of a familiar character: The lank hair tinged seaweed green, the darting tongue and faint lisp that call constant attention to the ghastly rictus of his mouth, the nightmarishly smudged make up&#x2026; taken together, they make previous Jokers feel like, well,<i>jokes</i>.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/dark-knight/review/290942#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) believes a cosmic storm could be the key to many genetic ailments, but must turn to his old college nemesis, billionaire Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who owns a high-tech space station, for funding. Victor, Reed, Reed's loyal friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and ex-girlfriend, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), as well as her brother, Johnny (Chris Evans), all arrive at the space station together, only to discover that the storm is mere minutes away. They appear to weather the experience intact, but after returning home begin to notice strange physical changes in themselves. Johnny gets all fired up &#x97; literally &#x97; while snowboarding; Sue discovers she can disappear and Reed finds himself as flexible as elastic. Ben undergoes the most dramatic alteration: His flesh takes on the consistency of craggy, orange rock, even as his personality survives unchanged. Brokenhearted when his fianc&#xE9;e rejects him, he inadvertently causes a traffic accident that nearly escalates into disaster. But the others use their new abilities to avert catastrophe and are quickly dubbed the Fantastic Four: Sue is the Invisible Girl, Johnny the Human Torch, leader Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic and poor Ben is renamed the Thing. While Reed tries to find a cure for their mutations, Victor is seething at the publicity they've attracted. His company in a shambles, and he's hiding the fact that he too has changed at the genetic level: Victor is now nearly all metal and able to harness electricity. In his fury, he plots to destroy the Fantastic Four and gain world domination. True fans will quibble that Dr. Doom should never have been aboard that space station, but the film has larger problems, starting with some lackluster effects and an uneven script. Superheroes' origin stories are inherently background-heavy, but director Tim Story and screenwriters Simon Kinberg, Michael France and Mark Frost spend too much time on setup. The cast is uneven: Reed Richards may be physically hyperflexibile, but Gruffudd plays him as a wooden good guy. Alba brings little more than phenomenal looks to her underwritten role and McMahon seems more narcissisticly peevish than truly evil. On the plus side, Chiklis finds the heart in the conflicted man-mountain and Evans nails the light tone Story seems to have wanted for the film overall.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/fantastic/review/191182#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Angel Cohn</i>

But this old-school melodrama actually worth a trip back to the theaters: Thanks to some first-rate acting from its stars, it ranks among Perry's best.</paragraph><paragraph>Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) and Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodward) are from entirely different worlds, but for the past 30 years they've been the best of friends. Charlotte is the tough, draconian matriarch of a very wealthy southern family that still maintains a controlling interest in the Cartwright Construction company, even though that family has been reduced to Charlotte and her arrogant son, William (Cole Hauser). Alice, on the other hand, is a single, working-class mother with two now-grown daughters, Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) and Pam (Taraji P. Henson). Down-to-Earth Pam works with Alice at her diner, while frighteningly ambitious Andrea is on a completely different career trajectory: Having received her masters in finance, she's now working as a high-level accountant for William; she's also sleeping with him despite the fact that they're both married, Andrea to Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), who works on Cartwright construction sites, and William to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), whom Charlotte loathes. Pam husband, Ben (Perry), works alongside Chris, but unlike his cuckolded brother-in-law, who wants to start his own construction company and hopes William will be his first investor, Ben is content with his lot in life. It's a delicate balance of relationships that begins to tremble when Charlotte coldly passes over William to hire Yale grad Abigail Dexter (Robin Givens) as Cartwright Construction's new COO. William is furious and plans on squeezing his mother out of the company by voting her off the board of directors, while Charlotte has plans of her own: She's bought a vintage turquoise Caddy convertible and has convinced Alice to accompany her on a fancy-free road trip west.</paragraph><paragraph>"Everybody has a story," Alice tells Pam, but in a Tyler Perry movie everyone has a least two. But grounding this whirlwind of inter-personal relationships is the lovely friendship between Charlotte and Alice that's completely sold by two very fine actresses. It's hard to reconcile the Charlotte we see telling her son that theirs is the kind of family that preys on the weak with the Charlotte who dreams of traveling the country like Gayle and Oprah, and who gets misty over corn like "I Hope You Dance," and in the end her character doesn't quite jibe. The direction is also strictly soap-opera grade and the production design surprisingly uninspired, but no matter. It's all about the drama, and with Bates and Woodard on board, it delivers.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/tyler-perrys-family-preys/review/295143#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Ken Fox</i>

Lucille Fowler (Ashley Judd) has spent much of her life living up to her nickname, "Luce" (say it out loud). She drinks too much, doesn't say "no" often enough, is estranged from her tight-lipped father, Lowell (Scott Wilson), and has all but given up on herself. But Lucy isn't a one-note country-music tragedy in the making. She's worked for local contractor Owen Allen (Stacy Keach) for nine years and has both his confidence and respect, and her drinking buddies &#x2014; a motley crew of older men and habitual barflies who hang out at a rundown local roadhouse called The Forge &#x2014; look out for her with the kind of devotion that's earned, not given. Lucy is loyal, self-reliant and kind to everyone but herself: She looks out for widowed neighbor Doll (Candyce Hinkle), whose mind is slowly slipping away, maintains close ties with her unhappy grandma (Diane Ladd) and aimless uncle Tim (Tim Blake Nelson), and even adopts the stray puppy that wanders into Owens' yard, swearing the dog is going to the pound even as she names her Bessie, stocks up on dog chow and makes veterinary appointments to treat the abandoned pup's wounded ear. When new-guy-in-town Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan) asks Lucy out on a date, her roommate, Kim (Laura Prepon of<i>That '70s Show</i>), suggests trying a different approach: Cal seems like a genuinely decent fellow, someone with whom Lucy might be able to have a real relationship. But old habits die hard and Lucy is caught up in a web of old habits and recurring hurts. After years of hiding her light under shallow, disposable Hollywood roles, Judd revisits the grit and vulnerability that made RUBY IN PARADISE (1993) such a revelation: Her Lucy &#x2014; the part Adams clearly wrote for herself &#x2014; is an all-too-human bundle of contradictory impulses whose banged-up arms and scabby knees bear witness to a life lived carelessly. Shot in Adams' hometown of North Little Rock, Arkansas, the film has a worn, live-in feel, and its unhurried narrative captures the subtle rhythms of small-town life. Nothing much happens on the surface, but worlds of hope, hurt and determination lie right behind the characters' eyes, waiting to be discovered.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/come-early-morning/review/283689#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Certainly that response might seem appropriate for any film that pertains thematically to a subject as emotionally challenging as the Holocaust, but writer-director Mark Herman's fictional story -- adapted from John Boyne's 2005 novel of the same name -- feels uncomfortable in an ill-advised way. A treatment of Holocaust-related discoveries shot through the eyes of an eight-year-old boy, it presents Nazi horror after Nazi horror, tempered by the irony of an innocent's continual misunderstandings. That alone is an interesting conceit and suggests dramatic promise; the problem, however, is that Herman fails to journey beyond the surface-level realities of his central perspective, which makes his film feel half-developed and poorly conceived, and drives it into sensationalism.</paragraph><paragraph>The tale itself pertains to Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the eight-year-old son of an unnamed Nazi officer (David Thewlis) and his wife, Elsa (Vera Farmiga). As the film opens, Bruno's dad receives an appointment to relocate the family from Berlin to a country house occupied by Nazi soldiers. The father's role ties directly into the extermination of the Jews; thus, an occupied concentration camp with gas chambers stands a few hundred feet from the house. Spotting the location from his bedroom window, Bruno misinterprets it as a farm, then defies his parents' orders to stay away from the place by visiting the fence, where he encounters a sweet-natured eight-year-old Jewish boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), dressed in a prison uniform (or the "striped pajamas" of the title), whom Bruno believes is involved in some sort of innocent "game" within the "farm." In time, the boys develop a fast friendship that results in tragic consequences.</paragraph><paragraph>To be certain, this picture does hint at some fascinating themes that the story could have explored, but that makes the movie extremely frustrating, for Herman skirts around the more intriguing notions that lie in the background of the tale. For example, he provides glimpses of Bruno's 12-year-old sister Gretel's (Amber Beattie) gradual indoctrination and brainwashing by the Nazis, and hints that this may on some level be tied to her stirrings of sexual attraction for a cruel Gestapo officer (Rupert Friend). But this subplot gets relegated to a footnote. And the director could easily have extended the narrative, temporally, into an intriguing and gripping look at how a family of brainwashed Nazis copes, on emotional and intellectual levels, with an intense family tragedy that they ultimately bring on themselves. But that simply isn't done here.</paragraph><paragraph>To his credit, Herman does seem to spend some of the film working toward the theme of the adult world gradually coming into focus through an innocent child's eyes, and the child slipping into permanent disillusionment, much as Gabriele Salvatores's brilliant<i>I'm Not Scared</i>(2003) did. And that represents the most profound, lofty, and noble of the movie's threads; to the extent that the film charts this territory, it renders itself semi-watchable. But Herman never wraps things up by bringing his lead character to a point of credible realization about what he's witnessing; the writer-director seems so eager to leave Bruno in a state of unblemished naivete that the final sequence undermines everything that has come before. We're asked to believe, for example, that Bruno still fails to grasp the horrific nature of the camp or the destructive toll taken on its inhabitants, even after he observes that Shmuel has been physically abused inside of the camp. In the end, Bruno's continued naivete merely looks like a convenient excuse to set up the film's final tragedy.</paragraph><paragraph>Admittedly, the film does benefit from some stellar performances, notably a four-barreled one by Farmiga, and a lead portrayal by young Butterfield that is magnificently wrought and convincing. These performances deserve better material, however; they should exist at the service of a script with ambitions loftier than merely stirring up indignation and easy sentiment in the audience and underscoring Holocaust barbarity -- which, in the final analysis, is all that the film really seems to be about. The motion picture accomplishes little other than elevating our own sense of human indecency, leaving us with a sense of emptiness and hopelessness while falling into the trap of exploitation. Given its subject, that feels absolutely inexcusable.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/boy-striped-pajamas/review/295835#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Nathan Southern</i>

And credit where it's due: The brothers' dark, all-star farce about sex, lies and surveillance is pretty damned funny.</paragraph><paragraph>CIA Balkan analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) has just quit his job, furious that his smug superiors were about to demote him, ostensibly because he has a drinking problem but more likely because of his foul temper and evident contempt for the rest of the human race. Osbourne's wife, ice-cold pediatrician Katie (Tilda Swinton), is furious: Osbourne's plan to start a consulting business and write his memoirs (sorry, mem-<i>wahs</i>) strike her as the height of deluded self-indulgence. Unbeknownst to Osbourne, Katie is having an affair with serial philanderer Harry Pfarrar (George Clooney) -- a charming horn dog who claims to have spent years bodyguarding top-level politicos without ever discharging his weapon (nudge nudge, wink wink) before taking a cushy gig at the Treasury Department -- and has engaged a cutthroat divorce lawyer. Harry is married to successful children's book writer Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel) and has no plans to divorce her, regardless of what he tells Katie or anyone else. Hardbodies health-club employee Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's longtime wife) is in the throes of a midlife crisis and wants to reinvent herself via plastic surgery she can't possibly afford. Then her genially brainless co-worker, Chet Feldheimer (Brad Pitt, delivering a broadly comic turn that's oddly charming despite its aggressive lack of subtlety), gets his hands on a disc full of top-secret sh*t -- Osawld's mem-<i>wahs</i>-- the janitor found in the ladies' locker room. Linda sees an opportunity&#x2026; an opportunity for blackmail, to be sure, but an opportunity none the less. Their inept attempts to cash in set in motion a farcical series of misunderstandings that end in mayhem, murder and massive confusion in the intelligence community.</paragraph><paragraph>Every Coen Brothers tic and mannerism fans of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN rejoiced they had abandoned is back in full force in BURN AFTER READING: The snarky dialogue, briskly artificial timing, absurd plot contrivances and cavalier willingness to exploit brutal suffering for laughs. And it's often funny and occasionally hilarious: Unlike many films in which the cast is clearly having a high old time, the audience isn't left out of the fun.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/burn-reading/review/293231#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>--<i>Maitland McDonagh</i>

Thus begins a ridiculous odyssey through space</paragraph><paragraph>with blazing rockets, death rays, and firefights among the stars, resulting in a slaphappy ending. This is a formula film for Brooks, one that has long ago worn out its welcome with viewers. Only Brooks shines momentarily as the president of the planet Spaceball and, in a dual role, as that of his</paragraph><paragraph>crinkled, ancient adviser, Yogurt. It's mostly forced humor all the way, a movie that rarely measures up to adequate kitsch. Aimed at younger audiences, SPACEBALLS misses its mark.<a href="http://movies.tvguide.com/spaceballs/review/118618#comments" class="obj-more-inline">leave a comment</a>
